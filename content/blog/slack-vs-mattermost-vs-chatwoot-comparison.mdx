category: "Tool Comparisons"
slug: "slack-vs-mattermost-vs-chatwoot-comparison"
faqs:
  - question: "What's the main difference between Mattermost and Chatwoot?"
    answer: "Mattermost is for internal team communication (replaces Slack), while Chatwoot is for customer support (replaces Intercom/Zendesk Chat). Mattermost has channels, threads, and integrations for team collaboration. Chatwoot has live chat widgets, ticketing, and CRM features for customer conversations. Choose Mattermost for team chat, Chatwoot for customer support, or deploy both (they integrate together)."
  - question: "Can Mattermost really replace Slack for a 50-person company?"
    answer: "Yes. Mattermost matches Slack's core features: unlimited message history, channels, threads, file sharing, integrations (1,000+ plugins), mobile apps, and video calls. You lose Slack Connect (external org channels) and some third-party integrations. But you gain unlimited users for flat hosting costs ($20-40/month vs $4,350/year for 50 Slack users), complete data ownership, and enterprise features (SSO, advanced permissions) that Slack charges extra for."
  - question: "How much does it actually cost to run Mattermost vs Chatwoot?"
    answer: "Mattermost: $10-20/month VPS for teams up to 50 users, $40/month for 50-200 users. Chatwoot: $5-10/month VPS for small support teams, $20-40/month for high-volume support. Compare to Slack ($7.25/user/month) or Intercom ($74/month base + $0.99/conversation). A 20-person team saves $1,500/year switching from Slack to Mattermost. A startup handling 500 chats/month saves $600/year switching from Intercom to Chatwoot."
  - question: "Which one is easier to set up and maintain?"
    answer: "Chatwoot is simpler (deploys in 15 minutes with docker-compose, minimal configuration). Mattermost is moderately complex (30-minute setup, requires domain/SSL for production). Both are significantly easier than enterprise alternatives. Monthly maintenance is 1-2 hours for both (Docker updates, backups, monitoring). If you can run 'docker compose up', you can self-host either tool."
  - question: "Can I migrate from Slack to Mattermost without losing message history?"
    answer: "Yes, with partial fidelity. Mattermost provides official Slack import tool (mmetl) that migrates: channels, direct messages, message history, file uploads, and users. What transfers: text messages, threads, reactions, files. What doesn't: some integrations, custom emojis (manual re-upload), Slack Connect channels. Migration process: Export Slack workspace → Convert with mmetl → Import to Mattermost. Typically takes 2-6 hours for a 50-person team's history."
  - question: "Do these tools work well together, or should I pick one?"
    answer: "They complement each other perfectly. Mattermost for internal team chat + Chatwoot for customer support is a common setup. They integrate: route Chatwoot customer messages to Mattermost channels, get notified when customers need help, collaborate on support responses internally. Think 'Slack + Intercom' but self-hosted. Total cost: $30-40/month vs $1,000+/month for SaaS equivalents."

# Slack vs Mattermost vs Chatwoot: Which Open Source Chat is Right for You?

Slack costs $7.25/user/month. Your 20-person team pays $1,740/year for chat that disappears after 90 days.

Intercom costs $74/month base plus $0.99 per conversation. Your 500 monthly customer chats add up to $1,383/year.

Combined SaaS chat expenses: $3,123/year for basic communication.

Mattermost and Chatwoot give you the same features for $30/month in hosting costs. That's $360/year total, saving $2,763 (88% reduction).

But here's the confusion: Mattermost and Chatwoot solve different problems. One replaces team chat, the other replaces customer support. Choosing the wrong tool means rebuilding your workflow.

This guide compares Slack, Mattermost, and Chatwoot across features, pricing, and use cases. You'll learn exactly which tool fits your situation and how to deploy it.

## Integration: Mattermost + Chatwoot

Route customer support issues to internal team channels.

### Chatwoot → Mattermost Webhook

**In Chatwoot:**

1. Settings → Integrations → Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://chat.yourdomain.com/hooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID`
3. Select events: `conversation_created`, `conversation_status_changed`

**In Mattermost:**

1. Integrations → Incoming Webhooks → Add
2. Select channel (e.g., `#customer-support`)
3. Copy webhook URL

**Result:** New customer chats appear in Mattermost `#customer-support` channel. Team can discuss, then respond in Chatwoot.

### Advanced: Auto-Assign Based on Keywords

Use n8n (workflow automation) to intelligently route:

```
Trigger: Chatwoot new conversation
Condition: Message contains "billing"
Action: Assign to billing team + notify #billing channel in Mattermost
```

## Migration Strategies

### Migrating from Slack to Mattermost

**1. Export Slack Data**

- Slack workspace → Settings → Import/Export → Export workspace data
- Download ZIP file (includes messages, files, users)

**2. Convert with mmetl (Mattermost Migration Tool)**

```bash
# Install mmetl
wget https://github.com/mattermost/mmetl/releases/download/v1.0.8/mmetl-linux-amd64
chmod +x mmetl-linux-amd64
mv mmetl-linux-amd64 mmetl

# Convert Slack export to Mattermost format
./mmetl transform slack --team myteam --file slack-export.zip --output mattermost-import.jsonl
```

**3. Import to Mattermost**

```bash
# Via CLI
docker compose exec mattermost mattermost import bulk mattermost-import.jsonl --workers 4
```

**4. Verify Migration**

- Check channels created
- Verify message history
- Test file uploads
- Confirm user accounts

**5. Parallel Run**

Run Slack and Mattermost simultaneously for 2 weeks. Move team gradually:

- Week 1: Engineering team pilots Mattermost
- Week 2: All teams join, Slack read-only
- Week 3: Cancel Slack subscription

**What transfers:**

- ✅ Channels and direct messages
- ✅ Message history (all text)
- ✅ File uploads
- ✅ Reactions
- ✅ Threads (structure preserved)

**What doesn't:**

- ❌ Custom integrations (rebuild in Mattermost)
- ❌ Slack Connect channels
- ❌ Some formatting (minor cleanup needed)

### Migrating from Intercom to Chatwoot

**1. Export Intercom Data**

Intercom → Settings → Data → Export data (CSV format)

**2. Import to Chatwoot**

Chatwoot doesn't have direct import yet. Two options:

**Option A: Manual migration (small volume)**

- Start fresh with Chatwoot
- Keep Intercom data for reference
- New conversations go to Chatwoot

**Option B: API migration (high volume)**

Use script to import via API:

```python
# import-intercom.py
import csv
import requests

CHATWOOT_API = "https://support.yourdomain.com/api/v1"
CHATWOOT_TOKEN = "your_api_token"

with open('intercom-export.csv') as f:
    for row in csv.DictReader(f):
        # Create contact
        contact = requests.post(f"{CHATWOOT_API}/accounts/1/contacts",
            headers={"api_access_token": CHATWOOT_TOKEN},
            json={"name": row["name"], "email": row["email"]}
        )
        # Import historical conversations...
```

**3. Update Website Widget**

Replace Intercom widget with Chatwoot widget (see deployment guide above).

**4. Train Team on Chatwoot**

- Demo session (1 hour)
- Side-by-side comparison guide
- Canned responses setup

## Performance and Scalability

### Mattermost Performance Benchmarks

| Team Size | Hardware              | Messages/Day | Response Time |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 10 users  | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM       | 500          | less than 50ms         |
| 50 users  | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM       | 2,500        | less than 100ms        |
| 200 users | 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM       | 10,000       | less than 150ms        |
| 1000 users| 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM      | 50,000       | less than 200ms        |

**Optimization Tips:**

- Use PostgreSQL (not MySQL) for better performance
- Enable Redis for caching
- Use S3 for file storage (scales infinitely)
- Enable CDN for file downloads

| less than 50 chats/day      | 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM    | 1-5    | less than 100ms        |
| 50-200 chats/day   | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM    | 5-15   | less than 150ms        |
| 200-1000 chats/day | 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM    | 15-50  | less than 200ms        |
| 1000+ chats/day    | 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM   | 50+    | less than 250ms        |

**Optimization Tips:**

- Enable Redis caching
- Use PostgreSQL connection pooling
- Offload email delivery to SendGrid/SES
- Use CDN for widget loading

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

**Mattermost:**

- Built-in user accounts (email/password)
- SSO via SAML, OAuth, LDAP, Active Directory
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP, hardware keys)
- Session management (timeout, concurrent sessions)

**Chatwoot:**

- Built-in accounts for agents
- SSO via OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- API tokens for integrations
- IP whitelisting (for admin panel)

### Data Security

**Both tools:**

- HTTPS required (Let's Encrypt)
- Database encryption at rest
- Encrypted backups to S3
- Regular security updates

**Mattermost-specific:**

- End-to-end encryption for mobile apps (Enterprise)
- Compliance exports (retain/delete based on policy)
- Audit logs for all actions

**Chatwoot-specific:**

- Customer data encrypted in database
- Conversation exports for GDPR requests
- Automatic PII detection (flag sensitive data)

## The Exit-Saas Perspective

Slack proved team chat is worth paying for. Then they kept raising prices: $7.25/user/month, then mandatory Business+ for features that should be standard, then Enterprise Grid that costs six figures.

The value didn't increase. The extraction did.

Mattermost gives you Slack circa 2018 (when it was still good) without the rent-seeking. Chatwoot gives you Intercom's core features without the conversation-based pricing that punishes success.

**The trade-off:** You manage the servers. That's 30 minutes of setup and 1-2 hours/month of maintenance. For most teams, that's worth $1,500-5,000/year in savings.

**The benefit:** Your chat history isn't held hostage. Your data doesn't train someone else's AI. Your costs don't scale with your team size. You own the infrastructure.

Chat is infrastructure, not a service. Treat it accordingly.
