# Plausible vs Google Analytics: Privacy-First Analytics Showdown

Google Analytics tracks 55% of all websites. It's also blocked by 42% of users running adblockers, slows page load by 423ms, and requires complex cookie consent banners.

Plausible Analytics offers a radically different approach: lightweight scripts, no cookies, no personal data collection, and GDPR compliance by default.

This isn't theory. Companies switching from GA4 to Plausible report 60% more accurate traffic data because adblockers don't block Plausible.

## The Core Philosophy Difference

**Google Analytics 4:**
Data collection tool designed to feed Google's advertising empire. Tracks individual users across sites, builds behavioral profiles, and monetizes your visitors.

**Plausible Analytics:**
Simple metrics dashboard focused on aggregate data. Tracks page views, referrers, and goals without identifying individuals.

This philosophical divide creates radically different products.

## Feature Comparison: What You Actually Need

### Basic Metrics

| Metric           | Google Analytics 4 | Plausible         |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Page views       | ✓                  | ✓                 |
| Unique visitors  | ✓                  | ✓ (anonymous)     |
| Bounce rate      | ✓                  | ✓                 |
| Visit duration   | ✓                  | ✓                 |
| Top pages        | ✓                  | ✓                 |
| Referrer sources | ✓                  | ✓                 |
| Geographic data  | ✓ (city-level)     | ✓ (country-level) |
| Device breakdown | ✓                  | ✓                 |

For 90% of websites, both tools provide identical insights for decision-making.

### Advanced Features

**Google Analytics 4 exclusive:**

- User-level tracking across sessions
- Cross-device attribution
- Predictive metrics (AI-powered)
- E-commerce tracking (enhanced)
- Custom dimensions (25+)

- Public dashboard sharing

The question isn't features—it's whether you need surveillance-level tracking.

## Privacy & Compliance: The Critical Difference

### Google Analytics Compliance Burden

**GDPR requirements for GA4:**

1. Cookie consent banner (mandatory)
2. Data Processing Agreement with Google
3. Privacy policy updates
4. Cookie policy documentation
5. GDPR-compliant data retention settings
6. IP anonymization configuration
7. User deletion requests handling

**CCPA requirements:**

- "Do Not Sell My Info" link
- Opt-out mechanism
- Data access requests
- Deletion workflow

**Setup time:** 6-12 hours (including legal review)
**Ongoing maintenance:** 2-4 hours/month
**Legal risk:** High (fines start at €20 million or 4% revenue)

### Plausible Compliance Reality

**GDPR requirements:**
None. Plausible doesn't collect personal data, so it's not subject to GDPR.

**CCPA requirements:**
None. No personal data = no compliance burden.

**Setup time:** 0 hours (install script, you're compliant)
**Ongoing maintenance:** 0 hours
**Legal risk:** None

**Why this works:**
Plausible doesn't collect:

- IP addresses (hashed for daily unique counts only)
- Personal identifiers
- Cross-site tracking data
- Cookies or local storage
- Fingerprinting data

If you don't collect personal data, privacy regulations don't apply.

## Performance Impact: Load Time Matters

### Script Size Comparison

**Google Analytics 4:**

- Initial script: 45.7 KB (gtag.js)
- Additional library: 17.4 KB (analytics.js)
- **Total: 63.1 KB**
- **Load time impact: 420-500ms** (3G connection)
- **Render-blocking:** Yes (delays First Contentful Paint)

**Plausible:**

- Script size: 0.9 KB (plausible.js)
- **Load time impact: 15-25ms** (3G connection)
- **Render-blocking:** No (async by default)

**Real-world impact:**
A 500ms delay in page load decreases conversions by 7-10% (Google research).

**SEO benefit:**
Google's Core Web Vitals penalize slow-loading scripts. Plausible improves your SEO ranking by reducing page load time.

## Data Accuracy: The Adblocker Problem

### Adblocker Blocking Rates (2026 data)

**Google Analytics blocked by:**

- uBlock Origin: 100%
- AdBlock Plus: 100%
- Privacy Badger: 100%
- Brave browser: 100% (default)
- Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection: 90%
- Safari ITP: 75%

**Estimated traffic invisible to GA4: 42%**

**Plausible blocked by:**

- Most adblockers: 0% (not on blocklists)
- Privacy-conscious browsers: 0%
- Estimated blocking rate: &lt;5%

**Why Plausible isn't blocked:**
Adblockers target tracking and advertising scripts. Plausible doesn't track or advertise, so it's not flagged.

**Business impact:**
If GA4 shows 10,000 monthly visitors, your actual traffic might be 17,200. You're making business decisions on 58% of data.

## Cost Comparison: SaaS vs Self-Hosted

Setting up Docker containers, configuring databases, and managing SSL certificates for analytics adds complexity. If you want self-hosted Plausible deployed with automated backups and monitoring, managed platforms provide production-ready instances.

## Migration Process: GA4 to Plausible

**Step 1: Run parallel for 30 days**

```html
<!-- Keep both scripts temporarily -->
<script
  async
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXX"
></script>
<script
  defer
  data-domain="yourdomain.com"
  src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"
></script>
```

**Step 2: Compare data**
| Metric | GA4 | Plausible | Difference |
|--------|-----|-----------|------------|
| Total pageviews | 145,230 | 248,910 | +71% (adblocker impact) |
| Unique visitors | 32,450 | 54,120 | +67% |
| Bounce rate | 43% | 45% | +2% |
| Avg. duration | 2:34 | 2:41 | +7 sec |

Plausible numbers are consistently higher because fewer users block it.

**Step 3: Verify goal tracking**

```javascript
// GA4 event
gtag("event", "signup", {
  event_category: "conversion",
});

// Plausible event
plausible("Signup");
```

**Step 4: Remove GA4**
After 30 days, remove GA4 script and cookie consent banner.

## The Exit-Saas Perspective

Google Analytics isn't free. You pay with your users' privacy and your site's performance.

Every visitor tracked by GA4 generates data that:

- Feeds Google's advertising algorithms
- Builds behavioral profiles used across the web
- Gets retained indefinitely in Google's systems
- Contributes to surveillance capitalism

Plausible offers a fundamentally different deal: simple metrics, no surveillance, complete transparency.

Whether you choose Plausible Cloud ($9/month) or self-host ($12/month VPS), you're opting out of the tracking economy. If you're new to self-hosting, start with our [Docker 101 guide](/blog/docker-101-self-hosting-beginners-guide).

Your website's analytics should serve you, not a $1.5 trillion advertising conglomerate. See our [TCO calculator](/blog/should-you-self-host-tco-calculator) to understand the true cost savings.

Check our [tools directory](/tools) for deployment guides and comparisons with other privacy-focused analytics tools like Umami, Matomo, and Fathom.

Privacy-first analytics isn't just ethical—it's more accurate, faster, and legally simpler. The only question is why you waited this long to switch.
