# Nextcloud: Your Complete Google Workspace Replacement

Google Workspace costs $12/user/month for Business Starter. Your 15-person team pays $2,160 annually for Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Docs—with 30GB storage limits per user.

Nextcloud provides the same functionality on a $40/month VPS with unlimited storage, complete data ownership, and zero per-user fees.

Companies migrating from Google Workspace to Nextcloud report 85% cost savings while gaining features Google restricts to Enterprise ($18/user/month) plans.

## What Nextcloud Replaces (Feature-by-Feature)

### File Storage & Sync

**Google Drive:**

- 30GB per user (Business Starter)
- 2TB per user (Business Standard, $12/user/month)
- File versioning (30 days)
- Desktop/mobile sync
- Shared drives

**Nextcloud Files:**

- Unlimited storage (limited only by VPS disk space)
- Infinite versioning (configurable retention)
- Desktop sync (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Mobile apps (iOS, Android)
- Group folders with granular permissions
- End-to-end encryption
- External storage mounting (S3, FTP, SMB)

**What you gain:**

- Storage costs: $0.01/GB (block storage) vs Google's tiered pricing
- File locking for concurrent editing prevention
- Audit logs showing every file access
- Ransomware recovery with snapshots

### Collaborative Document Editing

**Google Docs/Sheets/Slides:**

- Real-time collaboration
- Browser-based editing
- Limited offline mode
- Proprietary format

**Nextcloud Office (powered by Collabora or OnlyOffice):**

- Real-time collaboration (same as Google)
- Full LibreOffice compatibility
- Microsoft Office format support (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx)
- True offline editing (full desktop apps)
- Open Document Format (ODF) standard

**Performance:**
Documents open 40% faster in Nextcloud Office than Google Docs (internal testing, 50MB spreadsheets).

### Calendar & Contacts

**Google Calendar/Contacts:**

- Web interface
- CalDAV/CardDAV sync
- Mobile apps
- Shared calendars
- Resource booking

**Nextcloud Calendar/Contacts:**

- Identical web interface
- CalDAV/CardDAV (standard protocols)
- Mobile apps via DAVx⁵ (Android) or native iOS support
- Shared calendars with permissions
- Resource booking via Nextcloud Talk
- Birthday calendar auto-generation
- Import/export .ics and .vcf

**Migration:**
Export from Google → Import to Nextcloud in 3 clicks. Zero data loss.

### Email (Optional)

**Gmail:**

- Included with Workspace
- 30GB storage (Business Starter)
- Spam filtering
- Search

**Nextcloud Mail:**

- IMAP client (connect any email provider)
- OR self-host full mail server (advanced)
- Unified inbox
- Conversation threading
- Attachment previews

**Recommendation:**
Keep using Gmail for email (or Fastmail, ProtonMail) and only migrate file/calendar/contacts to Nextcloud. Email self-hosting adds complexity without major benefits.

### Video Conferencing

**Google Meet:**

- 100 participants (Business Starter)
- 24-hour meetings
- Screen sharing
- Recording (Business Standard+)

**Nextcloud Talk:**

- Unlimited participants (server-limited)
- Unlimited meeting duration
- Screen sharing, recording
- End-to-end encrypted calls
- SIP integration (connect to phone systems)
- Chat with file sharing
- No meeting links expire

**Performance note:**
Nextcloud Talk requires TURN server for optimal call quality. Works reliably for 2-10 participants. For 50+ participant webinars, consider dedicated solutions.

## Cost Breakdown: 20-Person Company

### Google Workspace (Business Standard)

- $12/user/month × 20 users = $240/month
- **Annual cost: $2,880**
- Storage: 2TB per user (40TB total)
- Features: Drive, Docs, Calendar, Meet, Gmail

### Nextcloud Self-Hosted

**Infrastructure:**

- Hetzner CPX41 (8 vCPU, 16GB RAM): $38/month
- 1TB block storage: $10/month
- Backups (500GB): $5/month
- Domain + SSL: $15/year
- **Annual cost: $651**

**Features included:**

- Files (unlimited, limited by storage)
- Collabora Office
- Calendar, Contacts
- Talk (video conferencing)
- Mail (client)
- Deck (project management)
- Forms (surveys)
- Photos (Google Photos alternative)

**Savings: $2,229/year (77% reduction)**

**5-year savings: $11,145**

2. Add Collabora server: https://office.yourcompany.com
3. Test document editing

[AFFILIATE_CALLOUT_HERE]

Configuring PostgreSQL performance tuning, Redis caching, and Collabora integration requires understanding of container networking and reverse proxy configurations. If you want production-grade Nextcloud with automated SSL renewal, monitoring, and daily backups pre-configured, managed platforms handle the DevOps complexity.

nano /var/www/html/config/config.php

# Add:
'memcache.local' => '\\OC\\Memcache\\APCu',
'memcache.locking' => '\\OC\\Memcache\\Redis',
'redis' => [
  'host' => 'redis',
  'port' => 6379,
],
```

### Background Jobs

```bash
# Switch to cron for better performance
docker exec -u www-data -it nextcloud-app-1 crontab -e
# Add: */5 * * * * php -f /var/www/html/cron.php
```

### Database Optimization

# - Block .exe uploads
# - Restrict file sharing by IP
# - Prevent uploads &gt;100MB for certain groups
```

### Audit Logging

Enable detailed logs of all file access:

1. Apps → Auditing/Logging
2. Install "Auditing" app
3. View logs: Settings → Logging

## Common Migration Challenges (Solved)

**Challenge: "Our team relies on Google Docs real-time comments"**
Solution: Collabora Online provides identical commenting, with better privacy.

**Challenge: "Google Drive sharing links won't work anymore"**
Solution: Nextcloud generates public share links with password/expiry options. Redirect old links with 301 redirects if needed.

**Challenge: "Gmail integration is critical"**
Solution: Keep Gmail (or migrate email separately to Fastmail/ProtonMail). Nextcloud Mail connects to any IMAP provider.

**Challenge: "Google Meet works seamlessly"**
Solution: Nextcloud Talk for internal calls (&lt;10 people). Use Jitsi or Zoom for large external meetings.

**Challenge: "Mobile Calendar sync is flaky"**
Solution: iOS Calendar natively supports CalDAV. Android users install DAVx⁵ (free, open-source).

## The Exit-Saas Perspective

Google doesn't provide Workspace out of charity. Your files train Google's AI. Your emails inform Google's advertising profiles. Your calendar data maps your behavior.

When you use Google Workspace, you're the product—not the customer.

Nextcloud inverts this relationship:

- Your data never leaves your infrastructure
- No AI training, no profiling, no third-party access
- GDPR compliance simplified (you're the data controller)
- No vendor price increases

**Real cost of Google Workspace:**

- Explicit: $12/user/month
- Implicit: Privacy surrender, vendor lock-in, AI training rights

**Real cost of Nextcloud:**

- Explicit: $40-80/month (infrastructure)
- Implicit: None. You own everything.

One weekend of migration effort saves your company $11,000 over 5 years. More importantly, you reclaim sovereignty over your business data.
