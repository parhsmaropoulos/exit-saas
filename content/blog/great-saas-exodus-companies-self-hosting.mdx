# The Great SaaS Exodus: Why Companies Are Self-Hosting Again

Basecamp spent $3.2 million on cloud infrastructure in 2022. In October 2022, they announced they're leaving the cloud entirely, expecting to save $7 million over five years.

37signals (Basecamp's parent company) isn't alone. Companies across industries are reversing a decade of "cloud-first" doctrine and bringing infrastructure back in-house.

This isn't nostalgia for 2010s-era server racks. It's a calculated response to SaaS pricing models that scale faster than revenue.

## The Numbers Behind the Exodus

### Public Migrations (Announced 2022-2026)

**37signals (Basecamp, HEY):**

- Previous AWS spend: $3.2M/year
- New infrastructure: $840K (hardware) + $286K/year (operations)
- 5-year savings: $7M
- Migration timeline: 18 months
- **Announcement:** October 2022, [blog post](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0)

**Discord:**

- Migrated message database from MongoDB Atlas to self-hosted ScyllaDB
- Previous cost: $150K/month ($1.8M/year)
- New cost: $50K/month ($600K/year)
- Savings: $1.2M/year
- Performance gain: 90% reduction in latency

**Dropbox:**

- Migrated from AWS S3 to custom infrastructure (2016, but trend continued)
- Saved $75M over 2 years
- Reduced per-user storage cost from $5 to $2

**Coinbase:**

- Self-hosts core exchange infrastructure
- Uses AWS only for ancillary services
- Estimated savings: $100M+ over 5 years
- Reason: Compliance, data sovereignty, cost

### Private Migrations (Industry Reports)

**Gartner survey (2025):** 47% of enterprises are "repatriating" cloud workloads back to on-premise or self-hosted infrastructure.

**Reasons cited:**

1. Cost overruns (68%)
2. Data sovereignty requirements (42%)
3. Performance issues (31%)
4. Vendor lock-in concerns (29%)

**A16Z report (2024):** Cloud costs now represent 30-50% of revenue for SaaS startups, up from 15-20% in 2019.

## Why SaaS Pricing Broke

### The Promise (2010-2015)

**SaaS vendor pitch:**

- "Pay only for what you use"
- "No upfront infrastructure costs"
- "Scales automatically with your business"
- "Cheaper than hiring DevOps team"

**This was true... initially.**

### The Reality (2020-2026)

**What actually happened:**

**1. Usage-based pricing became a tax on growth**

Example: Vercel pricing for Next.js hosting

- Free tier: 100GB bandwidth
- Pro: $20/month + $40 per 100GB overage
- Company with 2TB bandwidth/month: $20 + ($40 × 19.9) = $816/month

**Self-hosted equivalent:**

- Hetzner dedicated server: $45/month
- 20TB included bandwidth
- **Savings: $771/month ($9,252/year)**

**2. Per-user pricing doesn't match value delivered**

HubSpot Sales Hub: $100/user/month

- 10-person sales team: $12,000/year
- 50-person sales team: $60,000/year

Value delivered doesn't scale linearly with users, but pricing does.

**Self-hosted EspoCRM:**

- Cost: $850/year (regardless of users)
- 10 users: Saves $11,150/year
- 50 users: Saves $59,150/year

**3. "Free tier" lures, then pricing jumps**

Slack pricing evolution:

- 2014: Free tier with full search history
- 2018: Free tier limited to 10,000 messages (90 days for most teams)
- 2022: Standard plan $6.67/user/month
- 2024: Pro plan required for features once included in Standard
- **10-person team cost: $800/year → $2,400/year (200% increase)**

**4. Enterprise features held hostage**

Common SaaS pattern:

- Starter: $10/user (missing SAML SSO, audit logs)
- Professional: $25/user (adds SSO, still no audit logs)
- Enterprise: "Contact sales" ($100+/user)

**Security and compliance become upsell opportunities.**

| **Total**          |                             | **$156,000/year**       |

**Savings: $227,820/year (59% reduction)**

**ROI:** Even after hiring a dedicated DevOps engineer, saves nearly $230K annually.

## What Changed: Docker Revolution

### Pre-Docker Era (2005-2015)

**Self-hosting required:**

- Deep Linux knowledge
- Manual dependency management
- Custom deployment scripts
- Configuration drift across environments
- "Works on my machine" problems

**Deployment complexity = Barrier to entry**

**Result:** SaaS won because it was genuinely easier.

### Post-Docker Era (2015-Present)

**Self-hosting now:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattermost/docker
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
# Entire application stack running in 3 commands
```

**What Docker enabled:**

- Reproducible deployments
- Dependency isolation
- One-command scaling
- Platform independence

**Deployment complexity = Solved problem**

**Result:** SaaS convenience advantage disappeared.

## The Sovereignty Awakening

### Data Privacy Incidents That Changed Perception

**Zoom (April 2020):**

- Caught routing traffic through China despite claiming end-to-end encryption
- "Zoombombing" incidents exposed weak security defaults
- **Outcome:** Enterprises realized they had zero control over vendor practices

**SolarWinds (December 2020):**

- Supply chain attack compromised 18,000 customers
- Attackers had access for 9 months
- **Lesson:** SaaS vendor breach = you're breached

**Okta (March 2022):**

- Lapsus$ hacking group accessed internal systems
- 366 customer companies potentially compromised
- **Realization:** Identity provider breach = skeleton key to your entire company

**LastPass (August 2022):**

- Encrypted vaults stolen
- Attackers had 9 months of access to development systems
- **Trust destroyed:** Password manager, the ultimate trust service, fundamentally compromised

### GDPR Awakening (2018-Present)

**Before GDPR:** "Our vendors handle compliance"

**After GDPR:**

- €50M fine to Google (2019) for consent violations
- €746M fine to Amazon (2021) for data processing violations
- **Realization:** Using non-compliant vendor = you're liable

**Self-hosting solution:**

- Data never leaves EU infrastructure
- No third-party processor = simpler compliance
- Complete audit control

## The Technical Maturity Curve

### Phase 1: SaaS Adoption (2010-2018)

**Characteristics:**

- Small team (5-20 employees)
- Focus on product-market fit
- No DevOps expertise
- SaaS makes sense (speed over cost)

### Phase 2: SaaS Scaling Pain (2018-2022)

**Characteristics:**

- Growing team (20-100 employees)
- SaaS costs scaling faster than revenue
- Complexity from 20+ SaaS tools
- Integration hell (Zapier holding everything together)

### Phase 3: Selective Self-Hosting (2022-Present)

**Characteristics:**

- Mature team (50-200+ employees)
- Dedicated DevOps/Platform team
- Strategic tool evaluation
- **Hybrid approach:** Self-host commodity tools, keep SaaS for specialized services

**Migration pattern:**

1. First to self-host: GitLab (easy, high ROI)
2. Second: Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
3. Third: Internal communication (Mattermost)
4. Fourth: Project management (Taiga, Plane)
5. Keep SaaS: Email, accounting, payroll

## Economic Factors Accelerating Exodus

### 1. Venture Capital Pullback (2022-Present)

**Cheap VC money dried up.**

Startups can no longer afford to:

- Burn $500K/year on AWS
- Pay $100/user/month for every SaaS tool
- Ignore unit economics

**CFO conversation shift:**

- 2020: "Just use SaaS, we'll optimize later"
- 2024: "Why are we paying $400K/year for tools we could run for $50K?"

### 2. SaaS Vendor Consolidation

**Private equity playbook:**

1. Buy popular SaaS company
2. Fire half the engineering team
3. Increase prices 30-50%
4. Cut support quality
5. Extract maximum revenue

**Recent examples:**

- Salesforce acquiring Slack (price increases followed)
- Thoma Bravo buying Mailchimp, Plannuh, Stamps.com (price increases)
- Vista Equity buying Marketo, Pluralsight (quality decline reported)

**Customer response:** "If quality is declining while prices increase, why not self-host?"

### 3. AI Commoditization

**SaaS value prop used to be:**

- "We have data scientists building ML models you can't replicate"

**Now:**

- Open-source LLMs (Llama, Mistral) match proprietary models
- Self-hosting AI is feasible
- "Smart features" no longer justify 10x pricing premium

## Predictions: Where This Goes

### Short-term (2026-2028)

**SaaS vendors will:**

- Introduce "self-hosted" tiers (ironic reversal)
- Lower prices for loyal customers (retention focus)
- Add "data residency" options (EU, US regions)
- Acquire open-source competitors

**Companies will:**

- Migrate 30-50% of SaaS tools to self-hosted
- Keep SaaS for compliance-heavy services (payments, email)
- Invest in DevOps/platform engineering teams

### Long-term (2028-2032)

**Hybrid infrastructure becomes standard:**

- Self-hosted: Databases, internal tools, analytics
- SaaS: Specialized compliance (payments, email), AI services
- Edge: Static sites, CDN (Cloudflare, Vercel)

**New business models emerge:**

- Open-source companies offer "managed self-hosting"
- Example: You run GitLab on your infrastructure, GitLab provides support/updates
- **Best of both worlds:** Data sovereignty + vendor expertise

**Developer tooling improves:**

- Kubernetes becomes as easy as Docker Compose
- "Deploy button" for self-hosted apps becomes standard
- Infrastructure-as-code templates proliferate

## The Exit-Saas Philosophy

**This isn't anti-SaaS extremism.**

SaaS solved real problems:

- Eliminated upfront infrastructure investment
- Democratized access to enterprise software
- Enabled rapid experimentation

**But the pendulum swung too far:**

- "Cloud-first" became "cloud-only" without evaluation
- Convenience premium became exploitation
- Data ownership was surrendered without consideration

**The correction isn't "self-host everything."**

It's **selective self-hosting based on:**

1. Cost analysis (5-year TCO)
2. Technical capacity (do you have DevOps skills?)
3. Data sensitivity (compliance requirements)
4. Vendor lock-in risk (can you export data easily?)

**Companies that thrive:**

- Self-host commodity infrastructure
- Use SaaS for specialized services
- Maintain optionality (can switch either direction)

The future isn't SaaS or self-hosted. It's knowing the difference.
