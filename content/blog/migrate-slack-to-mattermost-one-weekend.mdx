# How to Migrate from Slack to Mattermost in One Weekend

Slack just increased prices again. Your 50-person team now pays $22,500 annually for Business+ tier. Meanwhile, Mattermost runs on a $40/month VPS serving unlimited users.

The migration seems daunting. You have 3 years of conversation history, 47 channels, custom integrations, and a team that resists change. But companies complete this migration every weekend with zero data loss.

This guide walks you through the entire process, from Friday afternoon planning to Monday morning launch.

## Why Teams Are Leaving Slack for Mattermost

Before diving into logistics, understand what you're gaining:

**Cost savings:**

- Slack Business+: $15/user/month × 50 users = $9,000/year
- Mattermost self-hosted: $480/year (VPS) + $120/year (backup storage) = $600/year
- **Annual savings: $8,400** (93% reduction)

**Data sovereignty:**

- All messages stored on your infrastructure
- No third-party AI training on your conversations
- GDPR/HIPAA compliance simplified
- Full audit trail control

**Feature parity:**

- Channels, threads, direct messages
- File sharing and search
- Custom integrations and webhooks
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android)
- SSO and LDAP support

The only thing you lose is Slack's vendor lock-in.

## Friday Afternoon: Pre-Migration Setup (3-4 hours)

### Step 1: Export Slack Data (30 minutes)

**For Slack Standard/Plus plans:**

1. Go to https://my.slack.com/services/export
2. Select date range (typically "All time")
3. Click "Start Export"
4. Download the ZIP file when ready (5-30 minutes depending on size)

**For Slack Free tier:**
Slack doesn't provide full export. Use third-party tools:

- `slack-export-viewer` (open source)
- Manual export of critical channels
- Accept that recent 90-day history limitation exists

**Export contains:**

- Channel messages and threads
- Direct messages
- File attachments (up to storage limits)
- User profiles
- Custom emoji

### Step 2: Deploy Mattermost (45 minutes)

**Option A: Quick VPS Deployment**

```bash
# SSH into your Ubuntu 22.04 VPS
ssh root@your-server-ip

# Install Docker
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install -y docker.io docker-compose

# Clone Mattermost Docker deployment
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/mattermost/docker
cd docker

# Configure environment
cp env.example .env
nano .env
```

**Critical `.env` settings:**

```bash
DOMAIN=chat.yourcompany.com
MATTERMOST_HTTPS_PORT=443
MATTERMOST_ENABLE_SSL=true
TZ=America/New_York
```

**Launch Mattermost:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Option B: Managed Deployment**

Setting up SSL certificates, configuring reverse proxies, and managing database backups adds complexity. If you want Mattermost deployed with automated SSL, monitoring, and daily backups already configured, managed platforms handle the infrastructure.

### Step 3: DNS and SSL Configuration (20 minutes)

**Set DNS A record:**

```
chat.yourcompany.com → your-server-ip
```

**Install SSL certificate (if not using managed hosting):**

```bash
apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
certbot --nginx -d chat.yourcompany.com
```

Visit `https://chat.yourcompany.com` and complete initial setup:

- Admin email: admin@yourcompany.com
- Team name: Your Company
- Create first team

### Step 4: Install Slack Import Plugin (15 minutes)

**Enable plugin uploads:**

1. System Console → Plugins → Plugin Management
2. Enable "Upload Plugin"
3. Download Slack import tool: https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-bulk-import
4. Upload via System Console → Plugins → Management

**Configure Mattermost for import:**

```bash
# Increase max file upload size
docker exec -it mattermost-docker_app_1 mattermost config set FileSettings.MaxFileSize 104857600
```

## Saturday Morning: Data Migration (2-3 hours)

### Step 5: Convert Slack Export to Mattermost Format (45 minutes)

Slack and Mattermost use different data structures. Use the official converter:

```bash
# Install mmetl (Mattermost Migration Tool)
wget https://github.com/mattermost/mmetl/releases/download/v1.0.0/mmetl
chmod +x mmetl

# Convert Slack export
./mmetl transform slack --team yourteam --file slack-export.zip --output mattermost-import.jsonl
```

**What gets converted:**

- Channels → Mattermost channels
- Users → Automatically created/matched
- Messages → Preserves timestamps and threading
- Reactions → Emoji reactions maintained
- Files → Uploaded to Mattermost storage

**What requires manual handling:**

- Custom Slack apps/bots (rebuild as webhooks)
- Zapier integrations (use n8n or native webhooks)
- Third-party apps (check Mattermost marketplace)

### Step 6: Import Data into Mattermost (60 minutes)

**Run bulk import:**

```bash
# Copy import file to Mattermost container
docker cp mattermost-import.jsonl mattermost-docker_app_1:/tmp/

# Execute import
docker exec -it mattermost-docker_app_1 mattermost import bulk /tmp/mattermost-import.jsonl --apply --workers 4
```

**Monitor import progress:**

```bash
# Watch logs
docker logs -f mattermost-docker_app_1
```

**Typical import times:**

- Small workspace (< 10K messages): 5-10 minutes
- Medium workspace (10K-100K messages): 30-60 minutes
- Large workspace (100K+ messages): 2-4 hours

**Common import errors:**

- File size limits → Increase in System Console
- Memory issues → Adjust Docker memory limits
- User email conflicts → Pre-create user accounts

### Step 7: Verify Data Integrity (30 minutes)

**Check channel import:**

```bash
# Compare channel counts
# Slack channels: Count from export
# Mattermost: System Console → Reporting → Site Statistics
```

**Verify message history:**

1. Open random channels in Mattermost
2. Search for known messages
3. Check file attachments load correctly
4. Verify @mentions and threading work

**Test user accounts:**

1. All Slack users should appear in Mattermost
2. Profile pictures imported (if available)
3. User statuses preserved

## Saturday Afternoon: Integration Migration (2-3 hours)

### Step 8: Recreate Critical Integrations

**GitHub notifications:**

```bash
# In Mattermost
/settings → Integrations → Incoming Webhooks → Add
Copy webhook URL

# In GitHub repository settings
Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook
Paste Mattermost webhook URL
```

**CI/CD notifications:**
Replace Slack webhook URLs in your CI config:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Notify Mattermost
  uses: mattermost/action-mattermost-notify@master
  with:
    MATTERMOST_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.MATTERMOST_WEBHOOK }}
    TEXT: "Deployment completed successfully"
```

**Custom bots:**
Port Slack bot logic to Mattermost:

```javascript
// Example: Simple notification bot
const axios = require("axios");

async function sendMattermost(message) {
  await axios.post("https://chat.yourcompany.com/hooks/xxx", {
    text: message,
    channel: "deployments",
  });
}
```

### Step 9: Configure SSO (Optional, 45 minutes)

**Connect to existing auth provider:**

1. System Console → Authentication → SAML 2.0
2. Configure with Google Workspace, Okta, or Azure AD
3. Test with personal account before company-wide rollout

**Benefits:**

- Single sign-on for all users
- Automatic user provisioning
- Centralized access control

## Sunday: Team Preparation (1-2 hours)

### Step 10: Create Migration Guide for Team

**Send email 2 days before migration:**

```

- Solution: Export early, verify contents before migration weekend

**Pitfall 2: Users forget new URL**

- Solution: Browser bookmarks, redirect old Slack URL

**Pitfall 3: Integration breakage**

- Solution: Test all critical integrations in staging before cutover

**Pitfall 4: Resistance to change**

- Solution: Involve team in decision, highlight cost savings

**Pitfall 5: Lost custom emoji**

- Solution: Export custom emoji separately, bulk import to Mattermost

## The Exit-Saas Perspective

Migrating communication platforms isn't just cost savings. It's reclaiming ownership.

When you use Slack, Salesforce (owner) controls:

- Price increases (15-25% annually)
- Feature access (Enterprise features behind paywall)
- Data retention (90-day limit on Free plan)
- AI training on your conversations

When you self-host Mattermost:

- Costs fixed at infrastructure level
- All features available to everyone
- Infinite message history
- Complete data privacy

One weekend of migration effort saves your company $42,000 over 5 years. That's a senior engineer's salary.

Explore our [tools directory](/tools) for more self-hosted collaboration alternatives. The best time to migrate was when Slack doubled prices. The second best time is this weekend.
