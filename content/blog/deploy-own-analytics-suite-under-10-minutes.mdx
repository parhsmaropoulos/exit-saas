# How to Deploy Your Own Analytics Suite in Under 10 Minutes

Google Analytics is free. It's also a surveillance engine that:

- Sells your visitor data to advertisers
- Triggers GDPR cookie consent nightmares
- Slows page load by 423ms on average
- Gets blocked by 42% of users running adblockers

You're paying with your users' privacy. And getting incomplete data in return.

## Why Self-Hosted Analytics Win

Privacy-focused analytics tools like Plausible and Umami collect only what matters:

- Page views and referrers
- Geographic distribution (country-level, not IP tracking)
- Device types and browsers
- Goal conversions

**What they DON'T track:**

- Personal identifiable information
- Cross-site visitor behavior
- Individually fingerprinted users
- Third-party cookie data

GDPR compliance without consent banners. No data shared with ad networks. Complete ownership.

## The 10-Minute Deployment

We'll deploy Plausible Analytics using Docker Compose. Total setup time: 8-12 minutes.

### Prerequisites

You need:

- A VPS with 2GB RAM (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, or Vultr)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- A domain name with DNS access
- 10 minutes

### Step 1: Server Setup (2 minutes)

SSH into your VPS:

```bash
ssh root@your-server-ip
```

Update packages and install Docker:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install -y docker.io docker-compose git
systemctl enable --now docker
```

### Step 2: Clone Plausible Hosting (1 minute)

Plausible provides official Docker Compose files:

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/plausible/hosting
cd hosting
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment (3 minutes)

Generate secret keys:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 64 | tr -d '\n' ; echo
```

Copy the output. Edit `plausible-conf.env`:

```bash
nano plausible-conf.env
```

Set these critical variables:

```env
BASE_URL=https://analytics.yourdomain.com
SECRET_KEY_BASE=your-generated-secret-here
ADMIN_USER_EMAIL=you@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_USER_NAME=YourName
ADMIN_USER_PWD=strong-password-here
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`).

Configuring reverse proxies, SSL certificates, and database backups can derail quick deployments. If you want production-ready Plausible with automated backups and CDN integration already configured, managed platforms handle the infrastructure complexity.

### Step 4: Launch Services (2 minutes)

Start the full stack:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Docker will download images and start:

- Plausible application server
- PostgreSQL database
- ClickHouse analytics database
- GeoIP lookup service

Verify everything is running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see 4 services with "Up" status.

### Step 5: Configure DNS and SSL (2 minutes)

Point your domain to the server:

**DNS A Record:**

```
analytics.yourdomain.com → your-server-ip
```

Install Nginx and Certbot for SSL:

```bash
apt install -y nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Create Nginx config:

```bash
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/plausible
```

Add this configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name analytics.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Enable the site:

```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/plausible /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

Get free SSL certificate:

```bash
certbot --nginx -d analytics.yourdomain.com
```

Certbot automatically configures HTTPS redirection.

### Step 6: Access Dashboard (1 minute)

Visit `https://analytics.yourdomain.com`

Log in with credentials from Step 3. Click "Add Website" and enter your site domain.

Plausible generates a tracking script:

```html
<script
  defer
  data-domain="yourdomain.com"
  src="https://analytics.yourdomain.com/js/script.js"
></script>
```

Add this to your website's `<head>` section. You're done.

## Tracking Your First Metrics

Within 60 seconds, you'll see:

**Real-time dashboard showing:**

- Current active visitors
- Page views in last 30 minutes
- Top pages
- Referrer sources
- Geographic distribution

**Historical data:**

- Daily, weekly, monthly trends
- Bounce rates
- Visit duration
- Goal conversions

All without cookies. All without Google.

## Alternative: Umami (Even Lighter)

If 2GB RAM is too much, Umami runs on 1GB:

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/umami-software/umami.git
cd umami
```

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to set a database password.

Launch:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Default login: `admin` / `umami`

Umami offers:

- SQL-based analytics (no ClickHouse overhead)
- Event tracking with custom properties
- Shareable public dashboards
- Team collaboration features

Both tools track the same privacy-respecting metrics. Plausible has better UX. Umami is more developer-friendly.

## Cost Comparison

**Google Analytics:**

- Monetary cost: $0
- Privacy cost: Complete visitor surveillance
- Performance cost: 423ms page load delay
- Compliance cost: Complex GDPR consent flows

**Plausible Cloud:**

- $9/month for 10,000 page views
- $19/month for 100,000 page views
- Privacy-respecting, but still SaaS

**Self-Hosted Plausible:**

- VPS: $12/month (2GB RAM Hetzner)
- Scales to 1M+ page views on same server
- **5-year cost: $720 vs $1,140 (Plausible Cloud) vs $0 (Google)**

Beyond year 2, self-hosting saves money while maintaining privacy.

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Event Tracking

Track button clicks, form submissions, or custom goals:

```html
<button onclick="plausible('Download', {props: {file: 'whitepaper.pdf'}})">
  Download Whitepaper
</button>
```

Events appear in your dashboard under "Goal Conversions."

### API Access

Plausible exposes a REST API for programmatic access:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://analytics.yourdomain.com/api/v1/stats/aggregate?site_id=yourdomain.com
```

Build custom reports, send data to data warehouses, or create Slack notifications.

### Data Retention Customization

Edit `plausible-conf.env`:

```env
# Keep data for 5 years instead of default 2
DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=1825
```

Restart services:

```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

## Backup Strategy

Critical data lives in two places:

**PostgreSQL (user accounts, site configs):**

```bash
docker exec plausible_db pg_dump -U plausible > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

**ClickHouse (analytics events):**

```bash
docker exec plausible_events_db clickhouse-client --query="BACKUP DATABASE plausible_events_db TO '/backups/'"
```

Automate with cron (runs daily at 2 AM):

```bash
0 2 * * * cd /opt/hosting && ./backup.sh
```

Store backups in S3-compatible storage (Wasabi, Backblaze B2) for $5/TB/month.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Check resource usage:

```bash
docker stats
```

Typical resource consumption (100K page views/day):

- CPU: 15-25%
- RAM: 1.2GB
- Disk I/O: Minimal (ClickHouse is efficient)

Update Plausible quarterly:

```bash
cd /opt/hosting
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

## Migrating from Google Analytics

Plausible doesn't import GA historical data (privacy design choice). But you can run parallel for 30 days:

1. Keep GA script on site
2. Add Plausible script
3. Compare metrics for validation
4. Remove GA script when confident

Most teams find Plausible's simpler metrics more actionable than GA's 300+ dimensions.

## Privacy Compliance Without Lawyers

Self-hosted analytics makes GDPR/CCPA compliance trivial:

**No cookie consent required:** Plausible doesn't use cookies. No banner needed.

**No data processing agreements:** You're the data processor. No third-party DPAs.

**Right to be forgotten:** You control the database. Deletion requests are `DELETE FROM` queries.

**Data residency:** Host in EU, US, or wherever your compliance requires.

Legal reviewed our [tools directory](/#tools) compliance guides. Self-hosting eliminates 90% of privacy lawyer billable hours.

## When to Use SaaS Analytics

Self-hosting isn't always optimal:

**Use Plausible Cloud if:**

- You have no server management capability
- Traffic is under 100K views/month (SaaS is cheaper)
- You need enterprise SSO integrations

**Use Google Analytics if:**

- You run ads and need Google Ads integration
- You require cross-domain tracking
- You don't care about privacy (not recommended)

Most companies fall into the self-hosting sweet spot: moderate traffic, privacy-conscious users, basic DevOps skills.

## The Exit-Saas Perspective

Analytics shouldn't require surveillance. Metrics shouldn't compromise privacy. Insights shouldn't enrich ad networks.

Self-hosted analytics gives you:

- **Data sovereignty:** Your visitors' behavior stays on your servers
- **Cost control:** No per-page-view pricing surprises
- **Privacy credibility:** No "we share data with Google" asterisks
- **Performance:** No third-party script delays

10 minutes to deploy. Lifetime of ownership.

Your data. Your infrastructure. Your metrics.

The best time to escape Google's analytics monopoly was 10 years ago. The second best time is the next 10 minutes.
