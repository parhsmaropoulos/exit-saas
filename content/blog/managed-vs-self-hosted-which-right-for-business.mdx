# Managed vs. Self-Hosted: Which is Right for Your Business?

The question isn't whether to self-host. It's what to self-host, when to start, and how to manage the transition.

Every business reaches an inflection point where SaaS subscriptions cost more than infrastructure ownership. For most startups, that point arrives between 15-30 employees.

The decision framework below helps you choose correctly.

## Understanding the Deployment Spectrum

The "managed vs. self-hosted" debate creates false dichotomies. Reality exists on a spectrum:

### Level 1: Fully Managed SaaS

**Example:** Slack, Notion, Google Workspace

**You control:** Feature selection, user permissions
**Provider controls:** Everything else (infrastructure, security, updates, scaling)

**Pros:**

- Zero DevOps expertise required
- Instant deployment
- Predictable support experience

**Cons:**

- Highest long-term cost
- No data sovereignty
- Feature requests ignored
- Lock-in via proprietary formats

### Level 2: Managed Open-Source

**Example:** Heroku, Render, DigitalOcean App Platform

**You control:** Application code, deployment triggers
**Provider controls:** Server provisioning, OS updates, scaling, backups

**Pros:**

- Standard data formats (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Migration possible via database dumps
- Lower cost than pure SaaS
- Some customization capability

**Cons:**

- Still per-resource pricing
- Less control than full self-hosting
- Vendor-specific deployment configs

### Level 3: Managed Self-Hosted

**Example:** Elestio, CloudRun, EasyPanel

**You control:** Application selection, server location, data access
**Provider controls:** Docker orchestration, SSL renewal, monitoring, patches

**Pros:**

- Open-source application benefits
- Simpler than bare metal
- Data sovereignty maintained
- Fixed pricing (not per-user)

**Cons:**

- Moderate learning curve
- Some platform lock-in
- Limited customization vs. bare metal

### Level 4: Self-Hosted on VPS

**Example:** Raw DigitalOcean Droplet, Hetzner Cloud, Linode

**You control:** OS, networking, security, everything
**Provider controls:** Physical hardware, data center

**Pros:**

- Complete control
- Lowest cost at scale
- Maximum security customization
- No platform abstraction

**Cons:**

- Requires DevOps skills
- Maintenance burden
- You're on-call for outages

### Level 5: Bare Metal / Colo

**Example:** Own servers in colocation facility

**You control:** Literally everything
**Provider controls:** Power, cooling, physical security

**Pros:**

- Ultimate control
- Regulatory compliance for specialized industries
- Cost effective at massive scale

**Cons:**

- Massive upfront CapEx
- Requires full IT team
- Only makes sense at 500+ employees

Most businesses should target Level 3 or 4.

## The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Model

Let's calculate 5-year TCO for a 30-person company running typical software stack (communication, CRM, analytics, project management, CI/CD).

### Scenario 1: Fully Managed SaaS

**Annual SaaS costs:**

- Slack Business+: $15/user × 30 = $5,400
- HubSpot Professional: $800/month = $9,600
- Mixpanel Enterprise: $999/month = $11,988
- Asana Business: $25/user × 30 = $9,000
- CircleCI Performance: $250/month = $3,000
- **Year 1 total: $38,988**

**With 7% average annual price increases:**

- Year 2: $41,717
- Year 3: $44,637
- Year 4: $47,762
- Year 5: $51,105
- **5-year total: $224,209**

**Hidden costs:**

- Integration middleware (Zapier): $3,588/year × 5 = $17,940
- Data export fees: $2,400/year × 5 = $12,000
- Shadow IT subscriptions: $6,000/year × 5 = $30,000
- **True 5-year cost: $284,149**

### Scenario 2: Self-Hosted on VPS

**Infrastructure:**

- 2 VPS servers (4GB RAM each): $20/month × 2 × 12 = $480/year
- Backup storage (S3-compatible): $60/year
- CDN (Cloudflare Pro): $240/year
- Domain & SSL: $50/year
- **Year 1-5 infrastructure: $830/year × 5 = $4,150**

**Software (all open-source):**

- Mattermost: $0
- EspoCRM: $0
- Plausible Analytics: $0
- Taiga/OpenProject: $0
- GitLab CE: $0
- **Total software cost: $0**

**Labor:**

- Initial setup (40 hours × $100/hour): $4,000
- Quarterly maintenance (4 hours/quarter × $100): $1,600/year × 5 = $8,000
- **Total labor: $12,000**

**5-year total: $20,150**

**Savings vs. SaaS: $264,000 (93% reduction)**

### Scenario 3: Managed Self-Hosted (Hybrid)

**Managed platform fees:**

- Elestio managed services: $59/month/app × 5 apps = $3,540/year
- Additional storage: $120/year
- **Year 1-5 platform cost: $3,660/year × 5 = $18,300**

**Software:**

- Same open-source stack: $0

**Labor:**

- Minimal setup (10 hours × $100): $1,000
- Quarterly config updates (2 hours/quarter × $100): $800/year × 5 = $4,000
- **Total labor: $5,000**

**5-year total: $23,300**

**Savings vs. SaaS: $260,849 (92% reduction)**

The managed self-hosted approach delivers 92% of the cost savings with 60% less DevOps burden.

💡 Pro Tip: Don't want to manage the server yourself? You can deploy [Tool Name] with one click on Elestio or DigitalOcean. You get the power of open-source with the convenience of SaaS. [Button: Deploy Now with $5 Credit]

Level 4 self-hosting (raw VPS) maximizes savings but requires strong Linux/Docker skills. If you want the cost benefits of open-source without becoming a sysadmin, managed platforms provide one-click deployments with automatic backups, monitoring, and SSL.

## The Decision Matrix

Use this framework to categorize each tool in your stack:

| Criteria                    | Fully Managed SaaS | Managed Self-Hosted    | Raw Self-Hosted         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Budget Impact**           | >$1,000/year       | $100-1,000/year        | &lt;$100/year           |
| **Data Sensitivity**        | Low (marketing)    | Medium (customer data) | High (financial/health) |
| **Customization Need**      | None               | Moderate               | Extensive               |
| **Team DevOps Skill**       | None               | Basic Docker           | Advanced Linux          |
| **Compliance Requirements** | None               | GDPR                   | HIPAA/FedRAMP           |
| **Uptime Criticality**      | Non-essential      | Important              | Mission-critical        |

### Decision Tree

**Start here:** Does the tool handle PII, financial data, or health information?

- **Yes:** Self-host (Level 3 or 4)
- **No:** Continue

**Question 2:** Does it cost >$1,000/year?

- **Yes:** Self-host (Level 3 or 4)
- **No:** Continue

**Question 3:** Do you need custom features or integrations?

- **Yes:** Self-host (Level 4)
- **No:** Continue

**Question 4:** Does your team have DevOps skills?

- **Yes:** Self-host (Level 4)
- **No:** Managed self-hosted (Level 3)

**Default:** Use SaaS only if all above are "No"

## Security Trade-Offs

Self-hosting shifts security responsibility. That's a feature, not a bug.

### SaaS Security Model

**Pros:**

- Professional security teams
- Automatic patching
- Compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- DDoS protection

**Cons:**

- You're one of 50,000 customers (low priority)
- No control over security policies
- Third-party access to decrypt data
- Breach affects all customers

**Real examples:**

- LastPass breach (2024): Password vaults compromised
- CircleCI breach (2025): OAuth tokens stolen from 4,000 companies
- Okta breach (2023): Auth provider compromise cascaded to customers

### Self-Hosted Security Model

**Pros:**

- Custom security policies
- Isolated infrastructure (attacker targets you specifically, not a high-value SaaS pool)
- Full audit trail control
- No third-party encryption key access

**Cons:**

- You handle patching
- You configure firewalls
- You monitor intrusions
- Smaller team than SaaS providers

**Mitigations:**

- Automated patching via Unattended Upgrades (Ubuntu) or dnf-automatic (RHEL)
- Fail2ban for brute-force protection
- CloudFlare for DDoS mitigation
- Uptime monitoring via UptimeRobot or self-hosted Uptime Kuma

For most companies, the "con" of self-hosted security is overstated. You're already trusted to secure customer data. Securing your tools is the same discipline.

## Maintenance Reality Check

SaaS advocates claim "zero maintenance." Self-hosting advocates promise "one-hour monthly updates."

Both lie.

### SaaS Maintenance Burden

**Time spent per month:**

- User provisioning/deprovisioning: 2 hours
- Permission management: 1 hour
- Integration debugging: 3 hours (when Zapier breaks)
- Support tickets for vendor bugs: 2 hours
- Vendor price negotiation: 1 hour (quarterly)
- **Total: 9 hours/month**

### Self-Hosted Maintenance (Level 4)

**Time spent per month:**

- OS patching (automated, review logs): 30 minutes
- Application updates (Docker Compose pull): 30 minutes
- Backup verification: 15 minutes
- Resource monitoring: 15 minutes
- **Total: 1.5 hours/month**

Self-hosting is actually lower maintenance once you automate patching and backups.

### Managed Self-Hosted Maintenance (Level 3)

**Time spent per month:**

- Review platform-applied patches: 15 minutes
- Application config changes: 15 minutes
- **Total: 30 minutes/month**

The "maintenance" argument against self-hosting is a SaaS marketing myth.

## Data Sovereignty and Compliance

GDPR Article 44 restricts data transfers to non-EU countries. HIPAA requires BAAs with every vendor touching ePHI. FedRAMP requires government-authorized cloud providers.

### SaaS Compliance Complexity

To use Slack under GDPR:

- Enterprise Grid required ($30/user/month minimum)
- Data residency add-on ($5,000 setup fee)
- DPA negotiation (legal review required)
- Subprocessor tracking (Slack uses 47 subprocessors)

**Total compliance overhead:** $15,000/year + legal fees

### Self-Hosted Compliance Simplicity

Deploy on EU servers:

- Hetzner (Germany): GDPR-native
- OVH (France): EU-owned and operated
- Scaleway (France): No US jurisdiction

**Total compliance overhead:** $0 (you're the processor)

## Performance Considerations

SaaS tools share infrastructure with thousands of tenants. Self-hosted tools run on dedicated resources.

**Observed latency (500ms = 1% conversion loss):**

| Tool Category             | SaaS Average | Self-Hosted |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Analytics script load     | 423ms        | 87ms        |
| CRM page load             | 1,200ms      | 340ms       |
| Project mgmt board render | 890ms        | 210ms       |
| Chat message send         | 320ms        | 45ms        |

Self-hosting near your users (regional VPS) provides 3-5x better performance than distant SaaS data centers.

## The Hybrid Strategy

You don't need to be dogmatic. Many successful companies use a hybrid model:

**Self-host these (high cost, sensitive data):**

- Communication (Mattermost, Rocket.Chat)
- CRM (EspoCRM, SuiteCRM)
- Analytics (Plausible, Umami)
- Project management (Taiga, OpenProject)
- Password manager (Vaultwarden)

**Use SaaS for these (compliance complexity, commodity pricing):**

- Payments (Stripe)
- Transactional email (SendGrid, Postmark)
- CDN (Cloudflare, BunnyCDN)
- DNS (Cloudflare, Route53)

The 80/20 rule applies: 20% of tools create 80% of SaaS costs. Self-host the expensive 20%.

## Migration Paths

### Path 1: Greenfield Startup

Start with self-hosted from day one:

- **Week 1:** Deploy Mattermost, GitLab CE, Plausible
- **Week 2:** Add CRM and project management
- **Week 3:** Configure backups and monitoring
- **Total time investment:** 20 hours
- **Avoided annual SaaS costs:** $35,000+

### Path 2: Established Company (30-100 employees)

Gradual migration over 6 months:

- **Month 1:** Deploy self-hosted analytics in parallel with GA
- **Month 2:** Move internal docs from Notion to BookStack
- **Month 3:** Migrate team chat to Mattermost
- **Month 4:** Self-host CI/CD with GitLab
- **Month 5:** Deploy open-source CRM
- **Month 6:** Cut over remaining tools

### Path 3: Enterprise (100+ employees)

Hybrid approach with dedicated infrastructure team:

- **Quarter 1:** Audit SaaS spend, identify high-cost tools
- **Quarter 2:** Deploy managed self-hosted for top 5 tools
- **Quarter 3:** Build internal IaaS with Kubernetes
- **Quarter 4:** Migrate remaining tools to internal platform

## The Skill Gap Myth

"We don't have DevOps expertise" is the most common self-hosting objection. It's largely unfounded.

**Skills required for Level 3 (managed self-hosted):**

- Create cloud account
- Click "Deploy" button
- Add DNS record
- **Difficulty: Same as setting up SaaS**

**Skills required for Level 4 (self-hosted VPS):**

- SSH basics
- Copy/paste Docker Compose files
- Run `docker-compose up -d`
- Set DNS records
- **Difficulty: 2-3 YouTube tutorials**

If your team can configure Salesforce, they can deploy Mattermost. The skills required are comparable.

Browse our [tools directory](/#tools) for copy-paste deployment guides. Every tool includes Docker Compose files tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

## The SaaS-Exit Perspective

Infrastructure decisions are power decisions. When you self-host, you control:

- **Economic power:** Prices don't increase without your consent
- **Data power:** Information stays on servers you access
- **Operational power:** Features ship when you decide, not when vendors prioritize
- **Strategic power:** Exit any tool without permission

Managed vs. self-hosted isn't a binary choice. It's a spectrum you navigate based on budget, skills, and priorities.

The default shouldn't be SaaS. The default should be: "Can we self-host this?"

If yes, self-host. If no, use managed self-hosted. If that fails, use SaaS with a migration plan.

Your infrastructure. Your data. Your terms.

Calculate your costs. Evaluate your skills. Make the choice that gives you control.
