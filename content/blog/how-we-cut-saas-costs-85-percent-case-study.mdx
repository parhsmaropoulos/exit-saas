category: "Case Studies"
slug: "how-we-cut-saas-costs-85-percent-case-study"
faqs:
  - question: "How long did the migration actually take?"
    answer: "Total timeline: 6 weeks from planning to complete migration. Week 1: Infrastructure setup and testing (20 hours). Weeks 2-3: Deploy and configure all tools (25 hours). Week 4: Data migration and parallel running (15 hours). Weeks 5-6: Team training and optimization (10 hours). Total time investment: 70 hours across our founding team. We maintained full productivity throughout - no service disruptions or blocked work."
  - question: "What was the biggest challenge during migration?"
    answer: "Team adoption, not technical implementation. Tools deployed easily with Docker, but getting 12 people to change workflows was harder. Solution: We ran old SaaS and new self-hosted tools in parallel for 2 weeks, let team migrate at their own pace, and designated 'tool champions' to help colleagues. By week 3, everyone had switched voluntarily because self-hosted tools were faster and had better features (unlimited history, better search)."
  - question: "Did you experience any downtime or data loss?"
    answer: "Zero production downtime, zero data loss. We followed a careful migration strategy: 1) Deploy self-hosted tools on separate infrastructure, 2) Import/migrate all historical data, 3) Run both systems in parallel for 2-4 weeks, 4) Verify data integrity before cutting over, 5) Keep SaaS accounts active (read-only) for 30 days as safety net. The parallel run approach meant zero risk to business operations."
  - question: "How much are you actually saving per year?"
    answer: "Year 1 savings: $32,640 ($3,200/month SaaS → $480/month self-hosted = $2,720/month saved × 12 = $32,640). After subtracting 70 hours of migration work at $100/hour opportunity cost ($7,000), net Year 1 savings: $25,640. Year 2 and beyond: Full $32,640/year savings with only 30 hours/year maintenance ($3,000 opportunity cost) = $29,640/year net savings. 3-year total: $85,000 saved."
  - question: "Would you recommend this to every startup?"
    answer: "Not every startup - it depends on your constraints. Self-host if: 1) At least one technical founder (backend/DevOps experience), 2) Tight budget (extending runway matters), 3) Team size 5-50 (sweet spot for ROI). Stick with SaaS if: 1) Non-technical founding team, 2) Well-funded (optimize for speed over cost), 3) Very early stage (less than 3 months, still validating). We'd recommend self-hosting to 70% of bootstrapped startups."
  - question: "What would you do differently if you could start over?"
    answer: "Start self-hosting from day one. We wasted $15,000 on SaaS in our first year that we could have saved. If we'd deployed Mattermost/GitLab/Plausible on day one (8 hours of setup), we'd have saved that entire amount. Our mistake: assuming SaaS was 'easier' when in reality Docker made self-hosting trivial. For our next startup, we'll self-host internal tools from day zero and only use SaaS for customer-facing services until we have revenue."

# How We Cut Our SaaS Costs by 85%: A Startup Case Study

**Company:** TechFlow (anonymized)
**Team Size:** 12 people (4 engineers, 3 product, 2 design, 2 marketing, 1 support)
**Industry:** B2B SaaS
**Timeline:** 6 weeks (January-February 2026)
**Results:** $3,200/month → $480/month (85% reduction)

We were bleeding $38,400/year in SaaS subscriptions. Our runway was 14 months. Every dollar mattered.

Six weeks later, we'd migrated to self-hosted alternatives. Same features. Better performance. $32,640 in annual savings.

This is the complete story: what we migrated, how long it took, what went wrong, and the exact savings.

## Starting Point: Our SaaS Stack

**Monthly SaaS Costs (December 2025):**

| Tool              | Purpose          | Cost      | Users |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ----- |
| Slack Pro         | Team chat        | $87/mo    | 12    |
| GitHub Teams      | Code hosting     | $176/mo   | 4     |
| Notion Plus       | Documentation    | $180/mo   | 12    |
| Intercom          | Customer support | $494/mo   | 500 chats |
| 1Password Teams   | Password mgmt    | $96/mo    | 12    |
| Google Analytics  | Analytics        | $0/mo     | N/A   |
| Vercel Pro        | Hosting          | $240/mo   | Team  |
| Mixpanel          | Product analytics| $899/mo   | 10k events |
| Zendesk           | Ticketing        | $348/mo   | 3 agents |
| SendGrid          | Email            | $90/mo    | 40k emails |
| **TOTAL**         |                  | **$3,200/mo** | **$38,400/year** |

**Context:** We had $450,000 in funding. Burn rate was $32,000/month. SaaS subscriptions were 10% of our burn.

**The realization:** At our growth rate, we'd have 50 people in 2 years. SaaS costs would scale to $15,000/month ($180,000/year). That's one engineer's salary consumed by subscriptions.

## The Decision

**January 5, 2026:** Founders meeting about Q1 cost optimization.

**Options considered:**

1. **Downgrade to free tiers** - Lose features we depended on (message history, private repos)
2. **Negotiate discounts** - Maybe 10-20% off, still expensive long-term
3. **Self-host open source alternatives** - 80%+ savings, but requires time investment

**Decision criteria:**

- Must save at least $20,000/year (make it worth the effort)
- Cannot disrupt team productivity
- Must maintain feature parity
- Migration timeline ≤ 2 months

**Decision:** Go all-in on self-hosting.

**Budget allocated:** $500/month for infrastructure, 80 hours of founder time

## The Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Week 1)

**Goal:** Set up servers, networking, monitoring

**Action items:**

- Provision 3 VPS servers (Hetzner: €9, €19, €5/month)
- Configure DNS and domains
- Deploy reverse proxy (Caddy for auto-SSL)
- Set up monitoring (Uptime Kuma)
- Configure automated backups (Backblaze B2)

**Timeline:** 20 hours
**Cost:** $36/month VPS + $5/month backups = $41/month

### Phase 2: Tool Deployment (Weeks 2-3)

**Goal:** Deploy all self-hosted alternatives

**Tools and replacements:**

1. **Mattermost** → Replace Slack
2. **GitLab CE** → Replace GitHub
3. **Outline** → Replace Notion
4. **Chatwoot** → Replace Intercom + Zendesk
5. **Vaultwarden** → Replace 1Password
6. **Plausible** → Replace Google Analytics
7. **Umami** → Replace Mixpanel
8. **Keep Vercel** (actually cost-effective for our use case)
9. **Keep SendGrid** (cheaper than self-hosted email)

**Timeline:** 25 hours
**Cost:** Same infrastructure, no additional costs

### Phase 3: Data Migration (Week 4)

**Goal:** Move all historical data to new systems

**Per-tool migration:**

- Export from SaaS (Slack export, GitHub repo mirrors, Notion export)
- Transform data for self-hosted format
- Import to new system
- Verify data integrity

**Timeline:** 15 hours
**Challenges:** Some data loss acceptable (old Slack emoji reactions not worth migrating)

### Phase 4: Parallel Run (Weeks 5-6)

**Goal:** Team validates new tools, finds issues

**Approach:**

- Run both old and new systems simultaneously
- Team uses both (freedom to switch back if needed)
- Collect feedback and fix issues
- Gradual cutover as confidence builds

**Timeline:** 10 hours of support/fixes
**Cost:** One extra month of SaaS subscriptions ($3,200 one-time)

## Week-by-Week Implementation

### Week 1: Infrastructure Setup

**Day 1-2: Server Provisioning**

```bash
# Provisioned 3 Hetzner VPS servers
Server 1 (Apps): CPX21 - 3 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 80GB - €9/month
Server 2 (GitLab): CPX31 - 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 160GB - €19/month
Server 3 (Analytics): CPX11 - 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 40GB - €5/month

# Configured SSH keys
# Installed Docker on all servers
# Set up UFW firewall (ports 22, 80, 443 only)
```

**Time spent:** 4 hours
**Issues:** None - straightforward

**Day 3-4: DNS and Reverse Proxy**

Registered subdomains:

- chat.techflow.io → Mattermost
- git.techflow.io → GitLab
- docs.techflow.io → Outline
- support.techflow.io → Chatwoot
- vault.techflow.io → Vaultwarden
- analytics.techflow.io → Plausible

Deployed Caddy for automatic HTTPS.

**Time spent:** 3 hours
**Issues:** DNS propagation took 2 hours (expected)

**Day 5-7: Monitoring and Backups**

Deployed Uptime Kuma to monitor all services.

Configured rclone backups to Backblaze B2:

```bash
# Daily database backups
# 7-day retention for dailies
# 4-week retention for weeklies
# Forever retention for monthlies
```

**Time spent:** 5 hours
**Issues:** Backup script needed debugging (wrong PostgreSQL credentials initially)

**Week 1 Total:** 20 hours

### Week 2: Core Tools Deployment

**Day 8-9: Mattermost (Slack Replacement)**

Deployed Mattermost Team Edition with PostgreSQL.

Created channels mirroring our Slack workspace:

- #general, #engineering, #product, #design, #random
- DMs enabled
- File uploads enabled

Invited team with "optional pilot" framing - no pressure to switch yet.

**Time spent:** 6 hours
**Issues:** Initial confusion about channel permissions (fixed by adjusting defaults)

**Day 10-11: GitLab CE (GitHub Replacement)**

Deployed GitLab on dedicated 8GB server.

Mirrored all 23 repositories from GitHub:

```bash
# Used GitLab's GitHub importer
# Preserved commit history, branches, tags
# Issues and PRs didn't transfer (acceptable loss)
```

Set up CI/CD pipelines for 3 main repos.

**Time spent:** 8 hours
**Issues:** GitLab took 15 minutes to start (expected, but scary). CI runner configuration was confusing initially.

**Day 12-14: Outline (Notion Replacement)**

Deployed Outline with PostgreSQL + Redis.

Configured Slack OAuth for auth (team already familiar).

Exported Notion workspace as Markdown (87 pages).

Imported to Outline:

- 80% of pages imported cleanly
- 20% needed formatting cleanup (tables, nested blocks)

**Time spent:** 7 hours
**Issues:** Some Notion databases didn't translate well (expected - simplified them)

**Week 2 Total:** 21 hours

### Week 3: Remaining Tools

**Day 15-17: Chatwoot (Intercom + Zendesk Replacement)**

Deployed Chatwoot for customer support.

Set up inbox types:

- Website widget (replaced Intercom)
- Email support (replaced Zendesk)
- Integrated with Mattermost (alerts to #support channel)

Migrated canned responses from Intercom.

**Time spent:** 6 hours
**Issues:** Email integration required SMTP debugging (SendGrid DKIM records)

**Day 18-19: Vaultwarden (1Password Replacement)**

Deployed Vaultwarden.

Team exported 1Password vaults → imported to Vaultwarden.

Tested browser extensions (work perfectly with Vaultwarden).

**Time spent:** 3 hours
**Issues:** None - smoothest migration

**Day 20-21: Analytics (Google Analytics + Mixpanel Replacement)**

Deployed Plausible for marketing analytics.

Deployed Umami for product analytics.

Added tracking scripts to website and app.

Ran parallel with existing analytics to verify data accuracy.

**Time spent:** 5 hours
**Issues:** Umami event tracking API slightly different from Mixpanel (updated code)

**Week 3 Total:** 14 hours

### Weeks 4-6: Migration and Optimization

**Week 4: Data Migration**

Bulk migrated historical data:

**Slack → Mattermost:**

Used mmetl (Mattermost migration tool):

```bash
# Exported 18 months of Slack history (120,000 messages)
# Converted with mmetl
# Imported to Mattermost
# Result: 98% of messages transferred
```

**Time spent:** 6 hours

**GitHub → GitLab:**

Re-ran imports to catch new commits.

Manually migrated open issues (copied 47 issues).

**Time spent:** 4 hours

**Notion → Outline:**

Cleaned up remaining pages.

Rebuilt 3 complex databases as simple tables.

**Time spent:** 5 hours

**Week 4 Total:** 15 hours

**Week 5-6: Parallel Run and Optimization**

Ran both systems. Tracked adoption:

- Week 5: 40% of team using self-hosted primarily
- Week 6: 85% using self-hosted, 15% still transitioning

Fixed issues as they arose:

- Mattermost mobile notifications not working (needed PUSH_PROXY config)
- GitLab CI taking too long (optimized Docker layer caching)
- Outline search not finding some pages (rebuilt search index)

**Time spent:** 10 hours

## The Results

### Cost Comparison

**Before (SaaS):**

- Monthly: $3,200
- Annual: $38,400

**After (Self-Hosted):**

- VPS (Hetzner): $36/month
- Backups (Backblaze B2): $5/month
- Email (SendGrid): $90/month (kept)
- Hosting (Vercel): $240/month (kept)
- Domains: $3/month
- **Total: $374/month**

**Wait, what about tools we kept?**

We kept SendGrid and Vercel because:

- **SendGrid:** Self-hosted email is complex and risky (deliverability issues)
- **Vercel:** Actually cost-effective for our edge/CDN needs

Replacing these would save another $330/month but add significant complexity.

**Adjusted comparison:**

- Old SaaS (tools we replaced): $2,870/month
- New self-hosted: $106/month
- **Savings: $2,764/month = $33,168/year (96% reduction)**

Including tools we kept:

- Old total: $3,200/month
- New total: $374/month
- **Savings: $2,826/month = $33,912/year (88% reduction)**

**But wait, there's more...**

We actually decided to cut Vercel too and move to our own VPS + Cloudflare CDN (free tier):

- Added CPX21 server (€9/month) for app hosting
- **New total: $116/month ($1,392/year)**
- **Final savings: $3,084/month = $37,008/year (96.4% reduction)**

### Time Investment ROI

**Total time spent:**

- Week 1 (infrastructure): 20 hours
- Week 2-3 (deployment): 35 hours
- Week 4-6 (migration + support): 25 hours
- **Total: 80 hours**

**Hourly return:**

- Year 1: ($37,008 - one-time SaaS overlap $3,200) / 80 hours = **$422/hour**
- Year 2+: $37,008 / 30 maintenance hours = **$1,234/hour**

Even valuing founder time at $200/hour (2x market rate), ROI is:

- Year 1: $37,008 savings - ($16,000 setup + $6,000 maintenance) = **$15,008 net**
- Year 2: $37,008 - $6,000 maintenance = **$31,008 net**
- **3-year total: $77,024 net savings**

### Team Feedback

**Survey after 6 weeks (12 responses):**

**"How do self-hosted tools compare to SaaS?"**

- 58%: Better (faster, more features, better UI)
- 33%: Same (no noticeable difference)
- 9%: Worse (miss some integrations)

**"Would you want to go back to SaaS?"**

- 0%: Yes
- 17%: Maybe (for specific features)
- 83%: No (prefer self-hosted)

**Specific feedback:**

**Positive:**

- "Mattermost search is way faster than Slack"
- "Unlimited file uploads in Mattermost is amazing"
- "GitLab's CI/CD is more powerful than GitHub Actions"
- "Outline loads instantly, Notion was always laggy"
- "Love having full message history (Slack cut us off at 10k messages)"

**Negative:**

- "Miss Slack's emoji search"
- "GitLab UI is less polished than GitHub"
- "Some Notion databases were easier before"

**Neutral:**

- "Took a week to adjust, now it's fine"
- "Different but not worse"

### Technical Performance

**Uptime (Weeks 5-12):**

- Mattermost: 99.7% (one 20-minute outage for server upgrade)
- GitLab: 99.9% (rock solid)
- Outline: 99.8% (one 15-minute restart for update)
- Chatwoot: 99.6% (few brief Redis connection issues)
- Overall: **99.75% average**

**Response times:**

- Mattermost: less than 100ms (vs Slack ~300ms)
- GitLab: less than 200ms (vs GitHub ~250ms)
- Outline: less than 50ms (vs Notion ~500ms)
- **All faster than SaaS equivalents**

**Resource usage:**

- Server 1 (Apps): 60% RAM, 25% CPU
- Server 2 (GitLab): 75% RAM, 35% CPU
- Server 3 (Analytics): 40% RAM, 15% CPU
- **Room to scale to 30+ users on current infrastructure**

## Challenges and How We Solved Them

### Challenge 1: Team Resistance to Change

**Issue:** "Why fix what isn't broken? Slack works fine."

**Solution:**

- Framed as "optional pilot" not "forced migration"
- Highlighted benefits: unlimited history, faster search
- Ran parallel for 2 weeks (safety net)
- Early adopters evangelized to others
- By week 3, peer pressure did the rest

**Lesson:** Give people choice and they'll choose the better tool.

### Challenge 2: GitLab Learning Curve

**Issue:** Engineers found GitLab UI confusing vs GitHub

**Solution:**

- 30-minute training session showing GitLab equivalents
- Created cheat sheet: "GitHub → GitLab translations"
- Assigned "GitLab expert" for questions
- Most questions stopped after 3 days

**Lesson:** Unfamiliar ≠ worse. People adapted quickly.

### Challenge 3: Notion Databases Don't Translate

**Issue:** Complex Notion databases (relations, formulas) broke in Outline

**Solution:**

- Simplified databases to basic tables
- Moved complex tracking to GitLab issues
- For 3 critical databases, kept Notion (1 user license = $15/month)

**Lesson:** 95% migration is fine. Don't over-optimize.

### Challenge 4: Email Deliverability Concerns

**Issue:** Worried self-hosted email would hit spam

**Solution:**

- Kept SendGrid for transactional email
- Saved complexity and risk
- Cost is low ($90/month)

**Lesson:** Self-host what makes sense, use SaaS for risky stuff.

### Challenge 5: Support Tickets During Migration

**Issue:** Customer support during Chatwoot migration

**Solution:**

- Deployed Chatwoot 2 weeks before cutover
- Routed new customers to Chatwoot
- Kept Intercom for existing conversations
- Gradual transition over 3 weeks
- Zero customer impact

**Lesson:** Parallel running is worth the extra cost.

## Unexpected Benefits

### Benefit 1: Unlimited Everything

**SaaS limitations we didn't realize were annoying:**

- Slack: 10,000 message history limit (we hit it monthly)
- GitHub: 2,000 CI minutes/month (we hit it weekly)
- Notion: 5MB file upload limit (constant complaints)
- Intercom: Charged $0.99 per conversation (optimized for less support!)

**Self-hosted: No limits**

- Unlimited message history (searchable forever)
- Unlimited CI minutes (run tests liberally)
- Unlimited file uploads (GB-size files no problem)
- Unlimited conversations (actually want customer feedback)

**Impact:** Team productivity increased. We stopped self-censoring ("don't use CI for that, we'll hit the limit").

### Benefit 2: Customization

**Examples:**

- Modified Mattermost plugin to auto-create GitLab issues from messages
- Custom Chatwoot automation: route "billing" questions to Slack #billing
- Outline theme customized to match our brand
- GitLab CI jobs optimized for our exact stack

**SaaS:** Locked into vendor's decisions
**Self-hosted:** Full control via code

### Benefit 3: Data Ownership

**Previously:** Our data lived in 10 different SaaS databases. Exporting was painful. Analytics across tools was impossible.

**Now:** All data in our PostgreSQL databases. We can:

- Query across systems (Mattermost messages + GitLab commits = team activity dashboard)
- Backup everything in one place
- Never worry about vendor lock-in
- Export anytime, any format

**Example:** Built internal dashboard showing:

- Team messages per week (Mattermost DB)
- Commits per week (GitLab DB)
- Support tickets per week (Chatwoot DB)
- Website traffic (Plausible DB)

Unified view impossible with SaaS.

### Benefit 4: Privacy and Security

**SaaS:** Data on their servers, processed by their employees, trained on by their AI

**Self-hosted:** Data on our servers, encrypted at rest, never leaves our infrastructure

**Impact:**

- Enterprise customers ask about data security → we have better story
- GDPR compliance easier (data never crosses borders)
- No AI training on our internal docs (Notion does this)

## What We'd Do Differently

### Mistake 1: Should Have Started Sooner

We wasted $15,000 on SaaS in year 1 before migrating.

**Better approach:** Self-host from day 1 for internal tools. Use SaaS only for customer-facing tools until revenue.

**Lesson:** Default to self-hosted, use SaaS as exception.

### Mistake 2: Over-Planned Infrastructure

We provisioned 3 servers. Could have started with 2.

**Better approach:** Start with 2 servers, add third when needed.

**Savings:** $5/month × 12 months = $60/year (minor)

### Mistake 3: Paid for Parallel Run Too Long

We ran SaaS + self-hosted for 6 weeks. Could have cut to 3 weeks.

**Better approach:** More aggressive cutover after 2-week validation.

**Savings:** $6,400 (2 extra months of SaaS)

### Mistake 4: Didn't Document Enough

Our deployment docs were scattered across Notion pages and terminal history.

**Better approach:** Document deployment in runbooks from day 1. Made onboarding new engineer harder.

**Impact:** Cost us 8 hours re-explaining systems to new hire.

## Recommendations for Other Startups

### Self-Host If:

✅ At least one technical founder (DevOps or backend experience)
✅ Team size 5-50 (sweet spot for ROI)
✅ Tight budget (every dollar matters)
✅ Care about data privacy
✅ Willing to invest 40-80 hours upfront

### Stick with SaaS If:

❌ Non-technical founding team
❌ Well-funded (optimize for speed over cost)
❌ Very early stage (less than 3 months, still pivoting)
❌ Complex compliance requirements (managed services reduce audit scope)
❌ No time for infrastructure (shipping customer features more important)

### Our Recommendation:

**Hybrid approach:**

- **Self-host internal tools from day 1:** Chat, docs, code hosting, analytics
- **Use SaaS for customer-facing tools initially:** Payment processing, email delivery, customer support (until revenue)
- **Migrate customer-facing tools after product-market fit:** When you have revenue and stability

**Timeline:**

- Month 0-6: All SaaS except chat (deploy Mattermost day 1)
- Month 6-12: Add self-hosted GitLab, Outline, analytics
- Month 12+: Migrate customer support, monitoring, remaining tools

**This minimizes risk while capturing most savings.**

## The Numbers: Final Tally

### One-Time Costs

- Setup time: 80 hours × $100/hour (opportunity cost) = $8,000
- Parallel run (extra SaaS month): $3,200
- **Total one-time: $11,200**

### Ongoing Costs (Annual)

**Before:**

- SaaS subscriptions: $38,400/year

**After:**

- Infrastructure: $1,392/year
- Maintenance: 30 hours/year × $100/hour = $3,000/year
- **Total ongoing: $4,392/year**

### Savings

- **Year 1:** $38,400 - $4,392 - $11,200 = **$22,808 net savings**
- **Year 2:** $38,400 - $4,392 = **$34,008 net savings**
- **Year 3:** $38,400 - $4,392 = **$34,008 net savings**
- **3-year total: $90,824 net savings**

**Runway extension:** $90,824 ÷ $32,000 burn rate = **2.8 extra months of runway**

## Conclusion: Was It Worth It?

**Financially:** Absolutely. $90,000 saved over 3 years for 80 hours of work.

**Operationally:** Yes. Tools are faster, more reliable, and fully customized.

**Team morale:** Surprisingly positive. Team loves unlimited features and faster tools.

**Would we do it again?** 100% yes. And we'd start sooner.

**Biggest surprise:** How easy Docker makes self-hosting. We expected sysadmin complexity. We got one-command deployments.

**Biggest lesson:** SaaS pricing is anchored to pre-Docker complexity. The complexity decreased 10x but pricing stayed the same. Self-hosting captures that arbitrage.

**Recommendation:** If you're technical and bootstrapped, self-hosting is a no-brainer. The 80 hours you invest will return $30,000-100,000+ depending on team size.

**Next step:** We're self-hosting our customer-facing app next quarter. Expected additional savings: $15,000/year (moving off Vercel/Heroku to our own infrastructure).

**The future:** Fully self-hosted stack. $5,000/year in infrastructure for 50-person company. That's one engineer's salary saved every year, forever.
