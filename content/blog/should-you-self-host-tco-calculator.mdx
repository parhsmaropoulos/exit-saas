category: "Decision Frameworks"
slug: "should-you-self-host-tco-calculator"
faqs:
  - question: "When does self-hosting save more money than SaaS?"
    answer: "Self-hosting typically saves 60-90% for teams with 10+ users when you have technical capacity. The break-even point is usually 3-6 months for project management tools, CRMs, and analytics platforms. Small teams under 5 people often see minimal savings after factoring in DevOps time at $85/hour for setup and maintenance."
  - question: "What hidden costs should I factor into self-hosting TCO?"
    answer: "Include DevOps labor at $85/hour for setup and maintenance, backup storage ($2-10/month), SSL certificates, monitoring tools, and potential downtime impact. Most tools require 30-60 minutes monthly maintenance. Don't forget opportunity cost—could that DevOps time generate more value building product features instead?"
  - question: "Do I need a DevOps engineer to self-host successfully?"
    answer: "Not for basic tools. If you can SSH into a server, read Docker logs, and run docker-compose commands, you can self-host 80% of business tools. Complex services like email servers or video conferencing require specialized expertise or should stay with SaaS providers."
  - question: "Which tools should I self-host first as a startup?"
    answer: "Start with analytics (Plausible), password managers (Vaultwarden), and project management (Taiga). These have simple Docker deployments, minimal maintenance burden, and immediate cost savings. Avoid email servers, payment processing, and accounting software initially due to compliance complexity."
  - question: "How do I calculate downtime cost for self-hosted tools?"
    answer: "Multiply your hourly business value by expected downtime hours. For e-commerce, use revenue per hour. For SaaS apps, calculate signup rate times customer LTV per hour. For internal tools, use employee hourly rate times productivity impact. Amateur setups average 20-40 hours downtime yearly versus 8.76 hours for SaaS with 99.9% SLA."
  - question: "What team size makes self-hosting financially worthwhile?"
    answer: "Self-hosting becomes cost-effective at 10+ users for most tools due to per-user SaaS pricing. A 20-person team saves $37,000 over 5 years on project management tools alone. However, teams under 5 people rarely see significant savings after factoring in the $85/hour DevOps labor cost for setup and maintenance."

# Should You Self-Host? TCO Calculator Breakdown

"Self-hosting saves money" sounds obvious until you factor in DevOps labor at $85/hour, backup storage, SSL certificates, monitoring tools, and the 3 AM server outage.

SaaS vendors love pointing to [these hidden costs](/blog/hidden-costs-saas-subscriptions-killing-profit-margins). "Sure, our CRM costs $50/user/month, but what about YOUR time managing a server?"

This guide breaks down real total cost of ownership (TCO) for 5 common business tools, comparing SaaS subscription fees against self-hosted infrastructure over 5 years. If you're new to self-hosting, check out our [Docker 101 guide](/blog/docker-101-self-hosting-beginners-guide) first.

The answer depends on team size, technical capacity, and growth trajectory—not one-size-fits-all platitudes.

## TCO Framework: What to Actually Count

### SaaS Total Cost (5 Years)

**Explicit costs:**

- Monthly subscription × 60 months
- Per-user fees (often increasing annually)
- Add-on features (SSO, advanced analytics, API access)

**Hidden costs:**

- Vendor price increases (15-25% annually for many SaaS)
- Migration lock-in (switching costs after 3 years)
- Data export fees
- Compliance add-ons (SOC2, HIPAA)

### Self-Hosted Total Cost (5 Years)

**Infrastructure:**

- VPS hosting × 60 months
- Backup storage × 60 months
- CDN/bandwidth (if applicable)
- Domain + SSL certificates × 5 years

**Labor:**

- Initial setup (DevOps time)
- Monthly maintenance (updates, monitoring)
- Incident response (outages, security patches)
- Upgrades and migrations

**Software:**

- Paid licenses (if not using FOSS)

**Note:** Jitsi requires more labor than typical self-hosted tools due to WebRTC complexity and user experience expectations.

[AFFILIATE_CALLOUT_HERE]

Configuring TURN servers, optimizing WebRTC bandwidth, and ensuring production-grade uptime for video conferencing requires specialized knowledge. If you want self-hosted collaboration tools deployed with professional monitoring and guaranteed uptime, managed infrastructure eliminates the DevOps burden.

## When SaaS TCO Beats Self-Hosting

### Scenario 1: Small Team (&lt;5 People)

**Example: Password manager**

- 1Password: $7.99/user/month × 5 = $40/month ($2,400 over 5 years)
- Self-hosted Vaultwarden: $12/month VPS + 10 hours setup/maintenance ($1,570 total)

**Savings: $830 over 5 years**

**Verdict:** Self-hosting wins financially, but $830 over 5 years is minimal. If no one on the team has DevOps skills, SaaS makes sense.

### Scenario 2: Rapid Scaling (2x growth annually)

**Example: Customer support ticketing**

- Year 1: 10 agents
- Year 5: 160 agents

**SaaS (Zendesk):**

- Scales automatically
- Per-user cost decreases with volume discounts

**Self-hosted:**

- Infrastructure costs scale linearly
- Labor increases for performance tuning
- Migration complexity mid-growth

**Verdict:** SaaS can be cheaper during hyper-growth due to economies of scale.

### Scenario 3: Zero DevOps Capacity

If your team has no one capable of:

- SSH into a server
- Read Docker logs
- Configure NGINX
- Debug database connection errors

**SaaS tax is cheaper than hiring a $120K DevOps engineer.** Learn more about [when NOT to self-host](/blog/when-not-to-self-host-honest-assessment) to avoid costly mistakes.

## Hidden Self-Hosting Costs (Be Honest)

### Opportunity Cost

**Real scenario:**
Your CTO spends 8 hours/month maintaining self-hosted infrastructure. At $150/hour effective rate, that's $1,200/month ($72,000 over 5 years).

**Question:** Could that time generate more than $72,000 in product value?

If yes, buy SaaS.
If no (infrastructure IS your product), self-host.

### Downtime Impact

**Calculate hourly business value:**

- E-commerce site: $5,000/hour revenue
- SaaS app: $500/hour (signup rate × LTV)
- Internal tool: $150/hour (employee productivity × hourly rate)

**Downtime estimate:**

- SaaS (with 99.9% SLA): 8.76 hours/year
- Self-hosted (amateur setup): 20-40 hours/year
- Self-hosted (professional setup): 4-8 hours/year

**Downtime cost difference:**
E-commerce with amateur setup: (35 hours - 8.76 hours) × $5,000 = $131,200 over 5 years.

**This alone can eliminate self-hosting savings.**

### Security Breach Cost

**Average data breach cost (2026):** $4.88 million

**SaaS advantage:**

- Dedicated security team
- SOC2/ISO27001 compliance
- Cyber insurance
- Vendor liability

**Self-hosted risk:**

- You're responsible for security
- Requires security expertise
- Proper configuration crucial

**Mitigation:**

- Automated security updates
- Regular penetration testing
- Monitoring and alerting
- Incident response plan

**If you can't do these, SaaS is safer.**

| Video conferencing | 100+      | High         | Hybrid       |
| Password manager   | &lt;20    | Low-Medium   | SaaS         |
| Password manager   | 20+       | Medium+      | Self-host    |
| Code repository    | Any       | Medium+      | Self-host    |
| Email              | Any       | Low-Medium   | SaaS         |
| Email              | Any       | High         | Still SaaS\* |

\*Email self-hosting adds minimal value and significant deliverability complexity.

## The Real Formula

```
Self-hosting is cheaper when:
(SaaS monthly cost × 60) > (Infrastructure × 60) + (Labor hours × hourly rate) + (Downtime cost) + (Security risk cost)

Self-hosting makes sense when:
1. Financial ROI is positive AND
2. You have technical capacity AND
3. Data sovereignty matters (privacy, compliance, IP protection)
```

## Real-World Hybrid Approach

**Most companies end up here:**

**Self-host:**

- Code repositories (GitLab)
- Project management (Taiga, Plane)
- Password manager (Vaultwarden)
- [Analytics (Plausible)](/blog/plausible-vs-google-analytics-privacy-first)
- File storage (Nextcloud)

**Stay SaaS:**

- Email (Gmail, Fastmail, ProtonMail)
- Accounting (Xero, QuickBooks)
- Payroll (Gusto)
- Legal/compliance tools

**Reasoning:**
Self-host tools where vendor lock-in is expensive and setup is straightforward. Stay SaaS for specialized domains requiring deep compliance expertise.

## The Exit-Saas Perspective

TCO calculations are useful, but they miss the fundamental question: **Who controls your business-critical data?**

**Financial case:** Save 60-90% over 5 years (for most tools)

**Strategic case:** Eliminate vendor dependencies that compound annually

**Risk case:** Remove single points of failure from your infrastructure

The best tool isn't always the cheapest. It's the one that aligns with your values, capacity, and trajectory.
