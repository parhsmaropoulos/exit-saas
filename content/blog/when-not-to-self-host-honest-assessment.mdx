# When NOT to Self-Host: Honest Assessment

Self-hosting isn't always the answer. Sometimes SaaS is cheaper, safer, and smarter.

This site advocates for data sovereignty and cost reduction through self-hosting. But we're not dogmatic zealots telling you to self-host everything down to your DNS resolver.

Some services have such high operational complexity, regulatory burden, or specialized expertise requirements that self-hosting becomes reckless.

This guide identifies 8 service categories where SaaS usually wins—and explains exactly why.

## 1. Email Servers (The #1 "Don't Do It")

### Why Everyone Wants to Self-Host Email

**Theoretical benefits:**
- Complete privacy (no Google scanning emails)
- Unlimited storage (your disk space)
- Custom domains and unlimited aliases
- No per-user fees

**The reality of running your own mail server:**

**Challenge 1: Deliverability is a nightmare**

Sending email from your VPS will land in spam because:
- Your server IP has no reputation
- Gmail/Outlook use complex spam algorithms
- One misconfigured SPF/DKIM/DMARC record = all mail blocked
- Blacklists are easy to get on, hard to get off

**Example:**
You send 100 cold outreach emails from your self-hosted server. Gmail flags your IP for spam patterns. Now all emails to Gmail users go to spam—including critical password resets for your customers.

**Challenge 2: 24/7 uptime is mandatory**

Email downtime = missed business-critical communications:
- Customer support requests bounced
- Password reset emails never delivered
- Invoice notifications lost

**Industry standard:** 99.99% uptime = 4 minutes downtime per month.
**Reality of self-hosting:** 99.5% uptime = 3.5 hours downtime per month.

**Challenge 3: Security vulnerabilities are constant**

Email servers are primary targets:
- Exploits in Postfix, Dovecot, SpamAssassin
- Brute force attacks on SMTP
- Backscatter spam from forged sender addresses
- Zero-day vulnerabilities require immediate patches

**You become a 24/7 security operations team.**

**Challenge 4: Regulatory compliance**

If you process email from EU citizens (GDPR) or store patient data (HIPAA), your email server must comply. This requires:
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access logging and monitoring
- Data retention policies
- Breach notification procedures
- Annual audits

**Total cost of self-hosted email (realistic estimate):**
- VPS: $24/month ($288/year)
- Backup MX server (redundancy): $24/month ($288/year)
- Spam filtering service: $10/month ($120/year)
- Monitoring and uptime tracking: $15/month ($180/year)
- Time spent on maintenance: 10 hours/month × $85/hour = $850/month ($10,200/year)
- **Total: $11,076/year**

**Cost of Google Workspace (10 users):**
- $12/user/month × 10 = $120/month ($1,440/year)
- Includes: Calendar, Drive, Meet, Security
- **Total: $1,440/year**

**Verdict: Gmail/Fastmail/ProtonMail wins by $9,636 annually.**

**When self-hosting email makes sense:**
- You're running a mail service as your product
- You have a dedicated sysadmin
- You process 100,000+ emails/day (economics change at scale)
- Government/military with air-gapped requirements

**For everyone else: Use a provider.**

## 2. Payment Processing (Legal Minefield)

### Why Self-Hosting Payments is Dangerous

**What "self-hosted payment processing" means:**
- Directly accepting credit card numbers
- Storing payment information
- Processing transactions yourself

**Legal requirements (PCI DSS Compliance):**

**Level 1 (&gt;6M transactions/year):**
- Annual on-site audit by Qualified Security Assessor (QSA): $50,000+
- Quarterly network scans by Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV): $10,000/year
- Maintain compliance documentation: 500+ hours/year

**Even Level 4 (&lt;20K transactions/year):**
- Self-assessment questionnaire (100+ questions)
- Quarterly vulnerability scans
- Security controls (firewalls, encryption, access logs)
- Incident response plan

**Penalties for non-compliance:**
- Fines: $5,000-100,000/month from card brands
- Liability for fraudulent transactions
- Lawsuit exposure if breached

**Example breach cost:**
Company with 10,000 customers suffers credit card breach.
- Notification costs: $50,000
- Credit monitoring (1 year): $150,000
- Legal fees: $200,000
- Fines and settlements: $500,000+
- Reputation damage: Priceless

**The SaaS alternative: Stripe**

**Pricing:** 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
**What you get:**
- PCI DSS Level 1 compliant (they handle it)
- Fraud detection and prevention
- Automatic 3D Secure authentication
- Dispute handling
- Global payment methods
- Mobile SDKs
- **Most importantly: You never touch card data**

**Cost comparison:**
- Processing $100,000/year in payments
- Stripe fees: $3,200
- Self-hosted PCI compliance: $75,000+ (audit, security, insurance)

**Verdict: Stripe wins by $71,800.**

**Exception:** Very high volume (>$50M/year) where 2.9% fee = $1.45M. At this scale, direct processor relationships make sense.

**For 99.9% of businesses: Use Stripe, PayPal, or Square.**

## 3. Video Conferencing (At Scale)

### Small Teams (&lt;10 people): Self-Host Works

**Jitsi Meet for 5-person team:**
- VPS (4GB RAM): $24/month
- TURN server: $15/month
- **Total: $39/month ($468/year)**

**Zoom Pro equivalent:**
- $15.99/user/month × 5 = $80/month ($960/year)

**Self-hosting wins by $492/year.**

### Large Meetings (&gt;20 participants): SaaS Wins

**Why self-hosted video breaks down at scale:**

**Bandwidth requirements explode:**
- 10-person call: 5 Mbps upload per participant
- 50-person call: 25 Mbps upload required
- 100-person webinar: Specialized infrastructure needed

**CPU requirements:**
- Jitsi videobridge transcodes video
- 50-participant call: 8-16 CPU cores required
- 100-participant call: Dedicated server cluster

**Network complexity:**
- TURN server for NAT traversal
- STUN server for connection discovery
- SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) architecture
- Load balancing across multiple bridges

**Real-world cost example:**

**Self-hosted for 100-person weekly all-hands:**
- High-performance VPS (16 vCPU, 32GB RAM): $160/month
- TURN server (high bandwidth): $80/month
- Bandwidth overage fees: $50/month
- DevOps maintenance: 8 hours/month × $85 = $680/month
- **Total: $970/month ($11,640/year)**

**Zoom Business (100 users):**
- $19.99/user/month × 100 = $1,999/month
- Unlimited meetings
- Cloud recording included
- Phone support
- **Total: $1,999/month ($23,988/year)**

**Wait, self-hosting wins financially?**

**Not quite. Hidden costs:**
- Call quality issues = lost productivity
- No recording transcription
- No breakout rooms (Jitsi limited)
- Mobile app experience inferior
- Participant troubleshooting time

**Realistic assessment:**
For companies with 50+ employees doing daily video calls, Zoom's reliability is worth the premium.

**Verdict: Self-host for &lt;20 regular participants. Use Zoom/Google Meet for larger or mission-critical meetings.**

## 4. Accounting Software (Regulatory Compliance)

### Why Self-Hosting Accounting is Risky

**Accounting software requirements:**
- Tax calculation accuracy (changes annually)
- Audit trails (legally required)
- Financial reporting compliance (GAAP/IFRS)
- Multi-currency support
- Bank reconciliation
- Payroll integration (if applicable)

**Example: Tax calculation errors**

Your self-hosted accounting system calculates sales tax incorrectly for California transactions. Over 2 years, you under-collect $15,000 in sales tax.

**Consequence:**
- You owe the $15,000 to California
- Plus penalties: 10% ($1,500)
- Plus interest
- Plus audit fees if they investigate further

**QuickBooks Online would have calculated correctly** because Intuit employs tax specialists who update rates automatically.

**Cost comparison:**
- QuickBooks Online Plus: $90/month ($1,080/year)
- Self-hosted Akaunting: $0 (open source)

**But hidden costs of self-hosting:**
- Accountant review of accuracy: 4 hours × $200/hour = $800
- Tax miscalculation risk: Potentially $10,000+
- Missing features (automatic bank feeds, tax forms)
- Time spent on manual data entry: 5 hours/month × $85 = $5,100/year

**Verdict: Accounting is worth paying for.** QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks win.

**Exception:** Very simple businesses (freelancers with &lt;100 transactions/year) can use open-source tools carefully.

## 5. DNS Hosting (Availability Critical)

### Why Self-Hosting DNS is Precarious

**DNS downtime = website and email down.**

**Challenges:**
- Requires multiple geographically distributed servers (resilience)
- DDoS attacks target DNS infrastructure
- DNSSEC implementation complexity
- Anycast routing requires BGP knowledge

**DIY DNS setup:**
- 3 VPS instances (different datacenters): $36/month
- DDoS protection: $50/month minimum
- Monitoring and alerting: $20/month
- **Total: $106/month ($1,272/year)**

**Cloudflare DNS:**
- Free tier: Unlimited queries, DDoS protection, global anycast network
- **Total: $0/year**

**Performance comparison:**
- Self-hosted: 80-200ms query time (single region)
- Cloudflare: 10-30ms (300+ datacenters worldwide)

**Verdict: Use Cloudflare, Route53, or another managed DNS.** Self-hosting DNS provides no practical benefit.

## 6. Certificate Authorities (Trust Infrastructure)

**You cannot practically run your own public Certificate Authority.**

**Why:**
- Getting root certificate trusted by browsers takes years
- Requires WebTrust audit ($50,000+/year)
- Liability for mis-issued certificates
- Revocation infrastructure (CRL, OCSP)

**Let's Encrypt is free and automated.**

```bash
# Install SSL certificate (free, automated)
certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

**Verdict: Never self-host a public CA.** Use Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL, or commercial CAs.

**Exception:** Internal CA for corporate devices (not public web).

## 7. SMS/Phone Services (Carrier Relationships Required)

### Why Self-Hosting SMS Fails

**What self-hosted SMS would require:**
- Contracts with mobile carriers (Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile)
- Phone number registration
- Compliance with TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act)
- A2P 10DLC registration (for business messaging)
- Throughput limits and rate limiting
- Spam filtering and compliance monitoring

**Carrier approval process:**
- Minimum volume commitments: 50,000 messages/month
- Security vetting
- Legal agreements
- Setup fees: $5,000-20,000

**Cost for 10,000 SMS/month:**
- Carrier contract: $500/month minimum
- Phone number rental: $50/month
- Infrastructure: $100/month
- Compliance monitoring: $200/month
- **Total: $850/month ($10,200/year)**

**Twilio pricing:**
- $0.0079 per SMS × 10,000 = $79/month
- **Total: $79/month ($948/year)**

**Savings: $9,252/year by using Twilio.**

**Verdict: SMS/voice should always use Twilio, Vonage, or similar.**

## 8. Backups (Ironic But True)

### The Backup Paradox

**Self-hosting requires backups.**
**But where do you backup self-hosted data?**

**Option 1: Backup to same server**
- Server dies → backups gone
- Ransomware encrypts everything including backups
- **Useless for disaster recovery**

**Option 2: Backup to second VPS you control**
- Better than Option 1
- Still vulnerable if attacker gets SSH access to both
- Requires maintaining second server

**Option 3: Backup to S3-compatible storage (Wasabi, Backblaze B2)**
- Encrypted backups off-site
- Geographic redundancy
- Immutable backups (can't be deleted by ransomware)
- **This is effectively using SaaS for backups**

**Recommendation:**
Self-host applications, but use cloud storage for backups.
- Backblaze B2: $5/TB/month
- Wasabi: $5.99/TB/month
- Amazon S3 Glacier: $1/TB/month (slower retrieval)

**Verdict: Self-host apps, use SaaS for backup storage.**

## Services Worth Self-Hosting (For Comparison)

| Service | Self-Host? | Reasoning |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Email server | ❌ No | Deliverability hell, 24/7 requirement, spam complexity |
| Payment processing | ❌ No | PCI DSS compliance costs exceed savings |
| DNS hosting | ❌ No | Free SaaS (Cloudflare) outperforms self-hosted |
| SMS/Voice | ❌ No | Carrier relationships required |
| Accounting | ❌ Usually no | Tax compliance risk |
| Video conferencing | ⚠️ Depends | &lt;20 users: yes. &gt;50 users: no |
| Backups | ❌ No | Use cloud storage for backup targets |
| Password manager | ✅ Yes | Simple to self-host (Vaultwarden), high privacy value |
| Git repository | ✅ Yes | Easy setup, huge cost savings (GitLab) |
| Project management | ✅ Yes | Simple Docker deployment, unlimited users |
| Analytics | ✅ Yes | Privacy benefit, no data sharing |
| File storage | ✅ Yes | Nextcloud replaces Google Drive easily |
| CRM | ✅ Yes | Cost savings scale with team size |
| Automation | ✅ Yes | n8n replaces Zapier, unlimited tasks |

## The Decision Framework

**Ask yourself 3 questions:**

### 1. Does this service require specialized compliance?
- Payment processing → PCI DSS (use SaaS)
- Healthcare data → HIPAA (evaluate carefully)
- Tax/accounting → Regulatory accuracy (use SaaS)
- Generic business data → No special compliance (can self-host)

### 2. What is the downtime cost?
- Email down = business paralysis → Use SaaS
- Analytics down = minor inconvenience → Self-host okay
- Video conferencing (weekly team call) = annoying → Self-host okay
- Video conferencing (customer demos) = revenue loss → Use SaaS

### 3. Do you have operational capacity?
- "What's SSH?" → Stay with SaaS for everything
- "I can deploy Docker containers" → Self-host 50% of tools
- "I manage Kubernetes clusters" → Self-host 90% of tools

## The SaaS-Exit Perspective (Being Honest)

**We advocate for leaving SaaS when it makes sense, not as ideology.**

Self-hosting email because "Google is evil" while losing 20% of your outbound emails to spam filters is cutting off your nose to spite your face.

**The goal isn't SaaS-Exit purity. It's control where it matters:**

**Self-host when:**
- Cost savings are significant (&gt;60%)
- Data sovereignty is valuable
- Setup complexity is manageable
- You have operational capacity
- Downtime risk is acceptable

**Stay SaaS when:**
- Compliance overhead exceeds savings
- Specialized expertise is required
- Infrastructure complexity is extreme
- Downtime is catastrophic
- Free tier exists (Cloudflare DNS)

**Most companies end up with hybrid:**
- Self-host: CRM, project management, analytics, file storage
- SaaS: Email, payments, accounting, SMS

This isn't compromise. It's pragmatism.
